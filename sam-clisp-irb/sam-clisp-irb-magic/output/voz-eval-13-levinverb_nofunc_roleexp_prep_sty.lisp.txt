There was once an old princess ; shehad a son and a daughter, both well built , both handsome . 
A wicked witch disliked them ; shepondered and pondered as to how shecould lead them into evil ways and destroy them . 
In the end she conceived a plan . 
Like a cunning fox shecame to their mother and said : ' My little dove , my dear friend , here is a ring for you ; put it on your your son's finger . 
With its help he will be healthy and wealthy , but he must never take it off , and he must marry only that maiden whom the ring fits . ' 
The old woman believed her and was overjoyed ; before her death sheenjoined upon her son that hetake to wife a woman whom the ring would be found to fit . 
Time went by and the little son grew up . 
Hegrew up and began to seek a bride; he would like one girl , then another , but upon trying the ring he always found it to be too big or too small ; it did not fit either the one or the other . 
Hetraveled and traveled through villages and cities , tried the ring on all the lovely maidens , but could not find one whom hecould take as his his betrothed; he returned home and was pensive and sad . 
' Little brother, why are yougrieving ? ' his his sisterasked him . 
Hetold herhis trouble . 
' Why is the ring so troublesome ? ' said the sister . 
' Let me try it . ' 
She put it on her finger and the ring clasped it , and began to gleam ; it fitted her as though made to her size . 
' Ah , my my sister, ' said the brother, ' you have been chosen for me by fate , you shall be my wife . ' 
' What are yousaying , my my brother? 
Think of God , think of the sin ; one does not marry one 's own sister . ' 
But her brother did not heed her ; he danced for joy and ordered that preparations be made for the wedding .
