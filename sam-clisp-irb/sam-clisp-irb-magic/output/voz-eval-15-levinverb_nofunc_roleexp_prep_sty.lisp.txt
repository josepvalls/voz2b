In a certain kingdom there was a king who had three daughters of surpassing beautythree daughters of surpassing beauty. 
The kingguarded themmore carefully than his most precious treasure ; hebuilt underground chambers and kept his daughters there like birds in a cage , so that rough winds could not blow upon them nor the red sun scorch themwith his rays . 
One day the princesses read in a certain book that there was a marvelous bright world , and when the kingcame to visit them, theystraightway began to implore himwith tears in their eyes , saying : ' Sovereign, our fatherSovereign, our fatherusout to see the bright world and walk in the green garden . ' 
The kingtried to dissuade thembut to no avail . 
Theywould not even listen to him; the more he refused , the more urgently theybesought him. 
There was nothing to be done , so the king granted their insistent prayer . 
And so the beautiful princesses went out to walk in the garden . 
They beheld the red sun , the trees , and the flowers , and were overjoyed that they had the freedom of the bright world . 
Theyran about in the garden and enjoyed themselves- when a sudden whirlwind seized them and carried them off far and high , no one knew whither .
