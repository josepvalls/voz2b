There was once a king who had three daughters , and such beauties they were as no tongue can tell of nor pen describe . 
Their garden was big and beautiful and they liked to walk there at night . 
A dragon from the Black Sea took to visiting this garden . 
One night the king 's daughters tarried in the garden , for they could not tear their eyes away from the flowers ; suddenly the dragon appeared and carried them off on his fiery wings .
