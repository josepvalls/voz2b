         ;; Julian lowered the crab trap into the water, just like his father showed him.
         ;;  As a ten-year-old, his arms quivered in anticipation as his father watched and waited.
         ;;  They kicked and clawed and the disturbed sea foam swirled violently.
         ;;  He looked to his father who nodded. Julian smiled and pulled the net closer to the boat.

         ;; Just as they reached the hull lip, the rope snapped from the weight.
         ;;  He tried to catch the torn end of the rope, but it was too late.
         ;;  The entire catch receded into the depths of the ocean.
         ;;  His father put his hand on Julian?s shoulder to comfort him.
         ;;  They went home empty-handed.
         ;;  He wanted to help his father catch crabs and for him to be proud.
