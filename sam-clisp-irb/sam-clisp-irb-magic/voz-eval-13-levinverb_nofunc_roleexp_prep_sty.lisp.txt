There was once an old princess ; she had a son and a daughter , both well built , both handsome . 
A wicked witch disliked them ; she pondered and pondered as to how she could lead them into evil ways and destroy them . 
In the end she conceived a plan . 
Like a cunning fox she came to their their mother and said : ' My My little dove , my my dear friend , here is a ring for you ; put it on your your son 's finger . 
With its help he will be healthy and wealthy , but he must never take it off , and he must marry only that maiden whom the ring fits . ' 
The old woman believed her and was overjoyed ; before her death she enjoined upon her her son that he take to wife a woman whom the ring would be found to fit . 
Time went by and the little son grew up . 
He grew up and began to seek a bride ; he would like one girl , then another , but upon trying the ring he always found it to be too big or too small ; it did not fit either the one or the other . 
He traveled and traveled through villages and cities , tried the ring on all the lovely maidens , but could not find one whom he could take as his his betrothed ; he returned home and was pensive and sad . 
' Little brother , why are you grieving ? ' his his sister asked him . 
He told her his trouble . 
' Why is the ring so troublesome ? ' said the sister . 
' Let me try it . ' 
She put it on her finger and the ring clasped it , and began to gleam ; it fitted her as though made to her size . 
' Ah , my my sister , ' said the brother , ' you have been chosen for me by fate , you shall be my my wife . ' 
' What are you saying , my my brother ? 
Think of God , think of the sin ; one does not marry one 's own sister . ' 
But her her brother did not heed her ; he danced for joy and ordered that preparations be made for the wedding . 
a daughter went to the lake , sat on the shore , and began to wind ropes of sand . 
Suddenly a little devil jumped out of the water and asked : ' What are a daughter doing here , a daughter ? ' 
' Ca n't you see ? 
a daughter 'm winding ropes ; a daughter want to thrash the lake and torment you devils , because you live in our lake but do not pay any rent . ' 
' Wait a while , a daughter , I 'll run and tell my my grandfather , ' said the little devil , and - flop ! - he jumped into the water . 
Five minutes later he was out again and said : ' Grandfather said that if a daughter can run faster than I , we 'll pay the rent ; if not , he told me to drag a daughter down into the lake . '
