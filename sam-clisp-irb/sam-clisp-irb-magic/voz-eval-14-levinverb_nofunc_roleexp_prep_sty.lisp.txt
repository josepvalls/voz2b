There was once a very wealthy merchant who had a marvelously beautiful daughter a marvelously beautiful daughter . 
This merchant carried goods to various provinces , and one day he came to a certain kingdom and brought precious cloths to the king as a gift . 
The king said to him : ' Why can I not find a bride for myself ? ' 
The merchant answered : ' I have a beautiful daughter , and she is so clever that no matter what a man is thinking , she can guess it . ' 
The king immediately wrote a letter and called his his guards . 
' Go to that merchant 's house , ' he told them , ' and deliver this letter to the merchant's daughter . ' 
The letter said : ' Make ready to get married . ' 
The merchant's daughter took the letter , burst into tears , and prepared to go , taking also her her maidservant ; and no one could distinguish this maid from the merchant's daughter , they were so like each other . 
They dressed in dresses that were alike and went to the king for the marriage . 
The maid was full of spite , and said : ' Let us take a walk on the island . ' 
They went to the island ; there the maidservant gave the merchant's daughter sleeping potions , cut out her eyes , and put them in her pocket . 
the king went to the lake , sat on the shore , and began to wind ropes of sand . 
Suddenly a little devil jumped out of the water and asked : ' What are the king doing here , the king ? ' 
' Ca n't you see ? 
the king 'm winding ropes ; the king want to thrash the lake and torment you devils , because you live in our lake but do not pay any rent . ' 
' Wait a while , the king , I 'll run and tell my my grandfather , ' said the little devil , and - flop ! - he jumped into the water . 
Five minutes later he was out again and said : ' Grandfather said that if the king can run faster than I , we 'll pay the rent ; if not , he told me to drag the king down into the lake . '

her maidservant came back and found her a very wealthy merchant who had a marvelously beautiful daughter gone . 
her maidservant gasped , and rushed to look in every corner , but could not find a very wealthy merchant who had a marvelously beautiful daughter . 
her maidservant called a very wealthy merchant who had a marvelously beautiful daughter , wept , and lamented that her the king and a marvelously beautiful daughter would scold her maidservant severely ; still her a very wealthy merchant who had a marvelously beautiful daughter did not answer . 
her maidservant ran into the open field ; the swan geese flashed in the distance and vanished behind a dark forest . 
The swan geese had long had a bad reputation ; they had done a great deal of damage and stolen many little children .
