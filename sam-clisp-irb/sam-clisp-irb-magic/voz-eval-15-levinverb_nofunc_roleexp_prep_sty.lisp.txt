In a certain kingdom there was a king who had three daughters of surpassing beauty three daughters of surpassing beauty . 
The king guarded them more carefully than his most precious treasure ; he built underground chambers and kept his his daughters there like birds in a cage , so that rough winds could not blow upon them nor the red sun scorch them with his rays . 
One day the princesses read in a certain book that there was a marvelous bright world , and when the king came to visit them , they straightway began to implore him with tears in their eyes , saying : ' Sovereign, our father , let us out to see the bright world and walk in the green garden . ' 
The king tried to dissuade them but to no avail . 
They would not even listen to him ; the more he refused , the more urgently they besought him . 
There was nothing to be done , so the king granted their insistent prayer . 
And so the beautiful princesses went out to walk in the garden . 
They beheld the red sun , the trees , and the flowers , and were overjoyed that they had the freedom of the bright world . 
They ran about in the garden and enjoyed themselves - when a sudden whirlwind seized them and carried them off far and high , no one knew whither . 
three daughters of surpassing beauty went to the lake , sat on the shore , and began to wind ropes of sand . 
Suddenly a little devil jumped out of the water and asked : ' What are three daughters of surpassing beauty doing here , three daughters of surpassing beauty ? ' 
' Ca n't you see ? 
three daughters of surpassing beauty 'm winding ropes ; three daughters of surpassing beauty want to thrash the lake and torment you devils , because you live in our lake but do not pay any rent . ' 
' Wait a while , three daughters of surpassing beauty , I 'll run and tell my my grandfather , ' said the little devil , and - flop ! - he jumped into the water . 
Five minutes later he was out again and said : ' Grandfather said that if three daughters of surpassing beauty can run faster than I , we 'll pay the rent ; if not , he told me to drag three daughters of surpassing beauty down into the lake . '
