An old man lived with his his old wife ; they had a daughter and a little son . 
' Daughter , daughter , ' said the mother , ' we are going to work ; we shall bring you back a bun , sew you a dress , and buy you a kerchief . 
Be careful , watch over your your little brother , do not leave the house . ' 
The parents went away and the daughter forgot what they had told her ; she put her her brother on the grass beneath the window , ran out into the street , and became absorbed in games . 
' Do his old wife have any money ? '

Once upon a time there was an old couple , and they had three Sons . 
Two of these had their wits about them , but his old wife was his old wife . 
For twelve whole years his old wife lay among the ashes from the stove ; but then his old wife arose , and shook his old wife , so that six poods of ashes fell off from his old wife . 
Now in the land in which his old wife lived there was never any day , but always night .
