A falcon lived with his his old wife ; they had The youngest son and a bright falcon . 
' The youngest son , The youngest son , ' said the mother , ' we are going to work ; we shall bring The youngest son back a bun , sew you a dress , and buy The youngest son a kerchief . 
Be careful , watch over your a bright falcon , do not leave the house . ' 
The parents went away and The youngest son forgot what they had told her ; The youngest son put her a bright falcon on the grass beneath the window , ran out into the street , and became absorbed in games . 
In a certain kingdom in a certain land there lived a king who had three sons three sons . 
One day they said to him : ' Father, our gracious sovereign , give us your blessing ; we wish to go hunting . ' 
The father gave them his blessing and they set out in different directions . 
The youngest son rode and rode and lost his way ; he came to a clearing , and there lay a dead horse , around which were gathered beasts of many kinds , birds , and reptiles . 
A falcon rose , flew up to the prince , perched on his shoulder , and said : ' Prince Ivan , divide that horse among us ; it has lain here for thirty years , and we have been quarreling ever since , unable to find a way of sharing it . ' 
The prince climbed down from his good steed and divided the carcass : he gave the bones to the beasts , the flesh to the birds , the skin to the reptiles , and the head to the ants . 
' Thank you , Prince Ivan , ' said the falcon . 
' For your kindness you shall be able to turn into a bright falcon or an ant whenever you wish . ' 
Prince Ivan struck the damp earth , turned into a bright falcon , soared up into the air , and flew to the thrice tenth kingdom .
