At that time a gypsy came to the village . 
He came at night and no matter where he looked , he could n't find anyone ! 
He finally entered the last hut where the last man was sitting and crying . 
' Greetings , good man ! ' 
' Why are you here , gypsy ? 
Surely , you must be tired of life . ' 
' Why do you say that ? '
