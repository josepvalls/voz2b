father lived with his his old wife ; they had one son called Ivashko and mother . 
' one son called Ivashko , one son called Ivashko , ' said the mother , ' we are going to work ; we shall bring one son called Ivashko back a bun , sew you a dress , and buy one son called Ivashko a kerchief . 
Be careful , watch over your mother , do not leave the house . ' 
The parents went away and one son called Ivashko forgot what they had told her ; one son called Ivashko put her mother on the grass beneath the window , ran out into the street , and became absorbed in games . 
There once lived an old couple who had one son called Ivashko ; one can tell how fond they were of him ! 
Well , one day , Ivashko said to his father and mother : ' I 'll go out fishing if you 'll let me . ' 
' What are you thinking about ! 
you 're still very small ; suppose you get drowned , what good will there be in that ? ' 
' No , no , I sha n't get drowned . 
I 'll catch you some fish ; do let me go ! ' 
So his his mother put a white shirt on him , tied a red girdle round him , and let him go . 
Out in a boat he sat and said : Canoe , canoe , float a little farther , Canoe , canoe , float a little farther ! 
Then the canoe floated on farther and farther , and Ivashko began to fish . 
When some little time had passed by , the old woman hobbled down to the river side and called to her her son : Ivashechko , Ivashechko, my boy , Float up , float up unto the waterside ; I bring thee food and drink . 
And Ivashko said : Canoe , canoe , float to the waterside ; That is my my mother calling me . 
The boat floated to the shore : the woman took the fish , gave her her boy food and drink , changed his shirt for him and his girdle , and sent him back to his fishing . 
Again he sat in his his boat and said : Canoe , canoe , float a little farther , Canoe , canoe , float a little farther . 
Then the canoe floated on farther and farther , and Ivashko began to fish . 
After a little time had passed by , the old man also hobbled down to the bank and called to his his son : Ivashechko , Ivashechko, my boy , Float up , float up , onto the waterside ; I bring thee food and drink . 
And Ivashko replied : Canoe , canoe , float to the waterside ; That is my my father calling me . 
The canoe floated to the shore . 
The old man took the fish , gave his his boy food and drink , changed his shirt for him and his girdle , and sent him back to his fishing . 
Now a certain witch had heard what Ivashko 's parents had cried aloud to him , and she longed to get hold of the boy . 
So she went down to the bank and cried with a hoarse voice : Ivashechko , Ivashechko, my boy , Float up , float up , onto the waterside I bring thee food and drink . 
Ivashko perceived that the voice was not his his mother 's , but was that of a witch , and he sang : Canoe , canoe , float a little farther , Canoe , canoe , float a little farther ; That is not my my mother , but a witch who calls me me . 
The witch saw that she must call Ivashko with just such a voice as his his mother had . 
So she hastened to a smith and said to him : ' Smith , smith make me just such a thin little voice as Ivashko Ivashko's mother has : if you do n't , I 'll eat you . ' 
So the smith forged her a little voice just like Ivashko Ivashko's mother 's . 
Then the witch went down by night to the shore and sang : Ivashechko , Ivashechko, my boy , Float up , float up , unto the waterside ; I bring thee food and drink . 
Ivashko came , and she took the fish , and seized the boy and carried him home with her .

a boat answered : ' a boat need only a smith , a boat have no use for a certain witch . ' 
They went to one son called Ivashko ; one son called Ivashko married a smith at once , and they began to live together . 
one son called Ivashko thought to one son called Ivashko : ' mother must have cheated one son called Ivashko ; a smith can not be a merchant 's daughter . 
Why is a smith so ignorant ? 
a smith does not know how to do anything . ' 
Meanwhile a certain witch recovered from the illness that her a smith had brought upon a certain witch . 
a certain witch could not see ; a certain witch could only hear and a certain witch heard an old man tending cattle cattle . 
a certain witch said to him : ' Where are you, grandfather ? ' 
' I live in a little hut . ' 
' Please take a certain witch into your hut . '
