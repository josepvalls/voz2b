There once lived an old couple who had whoever can bring me an apple ; one can tell how fond they were of whoever can bring me an apple ! 
Well , one day , whoever can bring me an apple said to his oldest and Her step-mother : ' whoever can bring me an apple 'll go out fishing if you 'll let whoever can bring me an apple . ' 
' What are whoever can bring me an apple thinking about ! 
whoever can bring me an apple 're still very small ; suppose whoever can bring me an apple get drowned , what good will there be in that ? ' 
' No , no , whoever can bring me an apple sha n't get drowned . 
whoever can bring me an apple 'll catch you some fish ; do let whoever can bring me an apple go ! ' 
So his Her step-mother put a white shirt on whoever can bring me an apple , tied a red girdle round whoever can bring me an apple , and let whoever can bring me an apple go . 
Out in a boat whoever can bring me an apple sat and said : Canoe , canoe , float a little farther , Canoe , canoe , float a little farther ! 
Then the canoe floated on farther and farther , and whoever can bring me an apple began to fish . 
When some little time had passed by , Her step-mother hobbled down to the river side and called to her whoever can bring me an apple : whoever can bring me an apple , whoever can bring me an apple , Float up , float up unto the waterside ; Her step-mother bring whoever can bring me an apple food and drink . 
And whoever can bring me an apple said : Canoe , canoe , float to the waterside ; That is my Her step-mother calling whoever can bring me an apple . 
The boat floated to the shore : Her step-mother took the fish , gave her whoever can bring me an apple food and drink , changed his shirt for whoever can bring me an apple and his girdle , and sent whoever can bring me an apple back to his fishing . 
Again whoever can bring me an apple sat in his his boat and said : Canoe , canoe , float a little farther , Canoe , canoe , float a little farther . 
Then the canoe floated on farther and farther , and whoever can bring me an apple began to fish . 
After a little time had passed by , oldest also hobbled down to the bank and called to his whoever can bring me an apple : whoever can bring me an apple , whoever can bring me an apple , Float up , float up , onto the waterside ; oldest bring whoever can bring me an apple food and drink . 
And whoever can bring me an apple replied : Canoe , canoe , float to the waterside ; That is my oldest calling whoever can bring me an apple . 
The canoe floated to the shore . 
oldest took the fish , gave his whoever can bring me an apple food and drink , changed his shirt for whoever can bring me an apple and his girdle , and sent whoever can bring me an apple back to his fishing . 
Now Wee little Havroshechka had heard what whoever can bring me an apple 's parents had cried aloud to whoever can bring me an apple , and Wee little Havroshechka longed to get hold of whoever can bring me an apple . 
So Wee little Havroshechka went down to the bank and cried with a hoarse voice : whoever can bring me an apple , whoever can bring me an apple , Float up , float up , onto the waterside Wee little Havroshechka bring whoever can bring me an apple food and drink . 
whoever can bring me an apple perceived that the voice was not his Her step-mother 's , but was that of Wee little Havroshechka , and whoever can bring me an apple sang : Canoe , canoe , float a little farther , Canoe , canoe , float a little farther ; That is not my Her step-mother , but Wee little Havroshechka whoever can bring me an apple . 
Wee little Havroshechka saw that Wee little Havroshechka must call whoever can bring me an apple with just such a voice as his Her step-mother had . 
So Wee little Havroshechka hastened to her spotted cow and said to her spotted cow : ' her spotted cow , her spotted cow make Wee little Havroshechka just such a thin little voice as whoever can bring me an apple Her step-mother has : if her spotted cow do n't , Wee little Havroshechka 'll eat her spotted cow . ' 
So her spotted cow forged her a little voice just like whoever can bring me an apple Her step-mother 's . 
Then Wee little Havroshechka went down by night to the shore and sang : whoever can bring me an apple , whoever can bring me an apple , Float up , float up , unto the waterside ; Wee little Havroshechka bring whoever can bring me an apple food and drink . 
whoever can bring me an apple came , and Wee little Havroshechka took the fish , and seized whoever can bring me an apple and carried whoever can bring me an apple home with Wee little Havroshechka . 
So a nobleman heated the stove hot , ever so hot , and said to whoever can bring me an apple , ' Come here and sit on this shovel ! ' 
Please teach whoever can bring me an apple how one ought to sit on a shovel . ' 
' Very good , ' said a nobleman ; ' it wo n't take long to teach whoever can bring me an apple . ' 
But the moment a nobleman sat down on the shovel , whoever can bring me an apple instantly pitched her into the oven , slammed to the iron plate in front of it , ran out of the hut , shut the door , and hurriedly climbed up ever so high an oak-tree ( which stood close by ) . 
You know , on the earth , there are good people good people and those who are a little worse those who are a little worse . 
Then there are those who don't fear God and don't even feel shame shame . 
Wee little Havroshechka was left motherless as a small child with the latter type . 
These people took her in and fed her but did n't allow her out into God 's world . 
Rather , they put her to work every day . 
She served , cleaned and answered for all and everything . 
Her Her step-mother had three grown daughters . 
The oldest 's name was One-Eye , the middle daughter 's name was Two-Eye , and the youngest 's name was Three-Eye . 
The only thing they did was sit in the entry way and gaze outside . 
Meanwhile Wee little Havroshechka did their work . 
She sewed their clothes and spun and wove for them , but never heard one word of kindness . 
She was only noticed when they wanted someone to abuse ! 
Once , Wee little Havroshechka went into the field . 
Embracing her her spotted cow , she lay against her neck and related how difficult her life was . 
' Little mother-cow , they beat me and scold me . 
They do n't feed me . 
And then they order me not to cry . 
They gave me 200 pounds of linen to spin , weave , bleach in the sun , and roll . 
It all must be done by tomorrow . ' 
The cow replied , ' Beautiful maiden , climb in one of my ears and climb out the other , and all of your work will be done . ' 
And so it was . 
As soon as the beautiful maiden climbed out of the cow 's ear everything was ready - woven , washed and rolled . 
She carried it to her her step-mother who shut it away in a trunk with a grunt . 
She then gave her even more work to do . 
Havroshechka came again to the cow . 
She climbed in one ear and out the other , carrying the completed things back . 
The old woman was amazed . 
She called One-Eye , ' My My wonderful daughter, my lovely daughter ! 
Find out who helps the orphan the orphan . 
Who weaves, spins and rolls the linen weaves , spins and rolls the linen ? ' 
One-Eye went with the orphan through the forest and into the field . 
She forgot her her mother 's instructions , became fatigued in the sun , and sprawled out in the grass . 
Havroshechka coaxed , ' Sleep , little eye . 
Sleep , little eye ! ' 
One-Eye 's one little eye fell asleep . 
While One-Eye slept , the little cow did the weaving and washing . 
As the step-mother did n't learn anything from One- Eye , she sent Two-Eye . 
Two-Eye also became fatigued in the sun , sprawled out in the grass , forgot her her mother 's instructions , and closed her eyes . 
Havroshechka sang , ' Sleep , little eye . 
Sleep , other little eye ! ' 
The cow did the weaving , washing , and rolling all while Two-Eye 's two eyes slept . 
The old woman was angry . 
On the third day she sent Three-Eye and gave the orphan even more work to do . 
And just like her older sisters , she bounded along and eventually fell into the grass . 
Havroshechka sang , ' Sleep , little eye . 
Sleep , other little eye ! ' 
But she forgot about Three-Eye 's third little eye . 
Two eyes fell asleep , while the third watched and saw everything : from the beautiful maiden climbing in one ear and out the other and then gathering up all the prepared linens . 
Three-Eye told her her mother everything she saw . 
The old woman rejoiced . 
On the very next day she came to her her husband , ' Slaughter that spotted cow ! ' 
The old man was reluctant . 
' What are you saying , woman ? 
Are you out of your mind ? 
That cow is young and healthy ! ' 
But she was absolutely determined . 
So , he sharpened the knife . 
Havroshechka ran to the cow . 
' Little cow-mother ! 
They want to slaughter you . ' 
' Do n't eat my meat , beautiful maiden . 
Gather my bones , tie them in a handkerchief , then plant them in the garden , and never forget me . 
Water my bones every morning . ' 
Havroshechka did everything as the cow instructed . 
She endured great hunger , but still did n't eat any meat . 
She watered the bones in the garden every day , from which an apple tree grew . 
Goodness , what a tree it was ! 
The apples were plump . 
The rustling leaves were golden . 
The bowing branches were silver . 
Whoever rode by stopped to look at the tree . 
Whoever walked by would stare in wonder . 
One day the girls were strolling in the garden when a nobleman rode through the field . 
He was wealthy , handsome , and young . 
Seeing the apples , he got the girls ' attention . 
' Maiden-beauties ! ' 
he said , ' whoever can bring me an apple me an apple will be my my wife . ' 
And so the three sisters pushed themselves in front of each other to get to the apple tree . 
While before the apples hung lower than arm 's height , suddenly they were oh so high , to the point that they were far above their heads . 
The sisters wanted to knock them off the tree , but the leaves blinded them . 
They wanted to pick the apples , but the branches unpicked their braids . 
No matter how they struggled and thrashed about , tearing their hands , they still could n't pick any apples . 
Havroshechka came to the tree . 
The branches bowed down and apples drooped into her reach . 
The nobleman married her . 
They lived in happiness , without any sorrow .

These people appeared near Kiev ; These people took heavy tribute from the people - a lovely maiden from every house, whom he then devoured . 
Finally , it was the fate of God to go to These people . 
You know , on the earth , there are good people good people and those who are a little worse those who are a little worse . 
Then there are those who don't fear God and don't even feel shame shame . 
Wee little Havroshechka was left motherless as a small child with the latter type .

Havroshechka did everything as the cow instructed .

She watered the bones in the garden every day , from which an apple tree grew . 
Goodness , what a tree it was ! 
The apples were plump . 
The rustling leaves were golden . 
The bowing branches were silver . 
Whoever rode by stopped to look at the tree . 
Whoever walked by would stare in wonder . 
One day the girls were strolling in the garden when a nobleman rode through the field . 
He was wealthy , handsome , and young .

And so the three sisters pushed themselves in front of each other to get to the apple tree . 
While before the apples hung lower than arm 's height , suddenly they were oh so high , to the point that they were far above their heads . 
The sisters wanted to knock them off the tree , but the leaves blinded them . 
They wanted to pick the apples , but the branches unpicked their braids . 
No matter how they struggled and thrashed about , tearing their hands , they still could n't pick any apples . 
Havroshechka came to the tree . 
The branches bowed down and apples drooped into her reach . 
The nobleman married her . 
They lived in happiness , without any sorrow . 
But no matter how much the her spotted cow and tsarina entreated Wee little Havroshechka , Wee little Havroshechka refused to go forth against These people . 
So they gathered together five thousand little children and sent them to implore Wee little Havroshechka , hoping that their tears would move Wee little Havroshechka to pity . 
The little children came to Wee little Havroshechka and begged Wee little Havroshechka with tears to go fight These people . 
Wee little Havroshechka began to shed tears when Wee little Havroshechka saw theirs . 
Wee little Havroshechka took twelve thousand pounds of hemp , tarred it with pitch , and wound it around Wee little Havroshechka so that These people could not devour Wee little Havroshechka , then went forth to give These people battle . 
' Better come out into the open field , ' said Wee little Havroshechka , ' or Wee little Havroshechka will destroy your lair together with These people ! ' 
And Wee little Havroshechka began to break down the door . 
These people , seeing that These people could not avoid trouble , went out to fight in the open field . 
Wee little Havroshechka fought These people for a long time or a short time ; in any event , Wee little Havroshechka defeated These people . 
Then These people began to implore Wee little Havroshechka : ' Do not put These people to death , Wee little Havroshechka ; no one in the world the world is stronger than Wee little Havroshechka and These people . 
Let us divide all the earth , all the world , into equal parts ; Wee little Havroshechka shall live in one half , These people in the other . ' 
' Very well , ' said Wee little Havroshechka , ' let us draw a boundary line . ' 
Wee little Havroshechka made a plow that weighed twelve thousand pounds , harnessed These people to it , and These people began to plow a boundary from Kiev ; These people plowed a furrow from Kiev to the Caspian Sea . 
' Now , ' said These people , ' we have divided the whole earth . ' 
' We have divided the earth , ' said Wee little Havroshechka , ' now let us divide the sea ; else These people will say that your water has been taken . ' 
These people crawled to the middle of the sea ; Wee little Havroshechka killed These people and drowned These people in the sea . 
That furrow can be seen to this very day ; it is fourteen feet high . 
Around it the fields are plowed , but the furrow is intact ; and those who do not know what it is , call it the rampart . 
Wee little Havroshechka , having done his heroic deed , would not accept any reward , but returned to currying hides .
