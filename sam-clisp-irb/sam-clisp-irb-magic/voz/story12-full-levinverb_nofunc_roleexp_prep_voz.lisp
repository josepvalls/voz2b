         ;; There was once a dragon that terrorized a little kingdom.
         ;; The dragon would kidnap the town's maidens.
         ;; One night the king had a dream where a tanner rescued his daughter from the dragon.
         ;; The king approached the tanner and asked him to rescue his daughter.
         ;; Eventually the tanner conceded and prepared to go fight the dragon.
         ;; He took a big mace and parted to seek the dragon.
         ;; The dragon died instantly.
         ;; The tanner rescued the princess.
         ;; The king offered the princess to the tanner in marriage.
         ;; But the tanner refused and went back to his old life.
