         ;; In a certain kingdom there was a king who had three daughters of surpassing beauty.
         ;; The king guarded them more carefully than his most precious treasure; he built underground chambers and kept his daughters there like birds in a cage, so that rough winds could not blow upon them nor the red sun scorch them with his rays.
         ;; One day the princesses read in a certain book that there was a marvelous bright world, and when the king came to visit them, they straightway began to implore him with tears in their eyes, saying: "Sovereign, our father, let us out to see the bright world and walk in the green garden."
         ;; The king tried to dissuade them but to no avail.
         ;; They would not even listen to him; the more he refused, the more urgently they besought him.
         ;; There was nothing to be done, so the king granted their insistent prayer.
         ;; And so the beautiful princesses went out to walk in the garden.
         ;; They beheld the red sun, the trees, and the flowers, and were overjoyed that they had the freedom of the bright world.
         ;; They ran about in the garden and enjoyed themselves - when a sudden whirlwind seized them and carried them off far and high, no one knew whither.
         ;; The servants traveled and traveled but did not discover anything and came back no wiser than they had set out.
         ;; The king called his grand council together and asked his councilors and boyars whether anyone among them would undertake to search for his daughters.
         ;; To any man who might find them, he said, he would give the princess of his choice in marriage, and a rich dowry.
         ;; The king asked once and the boyars were silent; he asked a second time and they still did not answer; he asked a third time and no one made a sound!
         ;; The king burst into tears.
         ;; "Apparently I have no friends or helpers here," he said, and ordered that a call be issued throughout the kingdom.
         ;; At that time there lived in one village a poor widow who had three sons; they were mighty champions.
         ;; All of them were born in one night - the eldest in the evening, the second at midnight, and the youngest in the early dawn, and therefore they were called Evening, Midnight, and Dawn.
         ;; When the king's call reached them, they straightway asked for their mother's blessing, made ready for their journey, and rode to the capital city.
         ;; They came to the king, bowed low, and said: "Rule for many years, sovereign!
         ;; We have come to you not to celebrate a feast, but to perform a task.
         ;; Give us leave to go in search of your daughters."
         ;; "Hail, good youths!
         ;; What are your names?"
         ;; "We are three brothers - Evening, Midnight, and Dawn."
         ;; "What shall I give you for your voyage?"
         ;; "We do not need anything, sire; only do not forget our mother, care for her in her poverty and old age."
         ;; The king took the old woman into his palace, and ordered that she be given food and drink from his table and clothes and shoes from his stores.
         ;; They rode one month, a second, and a third; then they came to a wide desert steppe.
         ;; Beyond that steppe was a thick forest, and close to the forest stood a little hut.
         ;; They knocked at the window and there was no answer; they entered and no one was in the hut.
         ;; "Well, brothers," said one of the three, "let us stop here for a time and rest from our travels."
         ;; They undressed, prayed to God, and went to sleep.
         ;; Next morning Dawn, the youngest brother, said to Evening, his eldest brother: "We two shall go hunting, and you stay at home and prepare our dinner."
         ;; The eldest brother consented.
         ;; Near the hut there was a shed full of sheep; without thinking much he took the best ram, slaughtered and cleaned it, and put it onto roast for dinner.
         ;; He prepared everything and lay down to rest on a bench.
         ;; Suddenly there was a rumbling noise, the door opened, and there entered a little man as big as a thumb, with a beard a cubit long.
         ;; He cast an angry look around and cried to Evening: "How dared you make yourself at home in my house, how dared you slaughter my ram?"
         ;; Evening answered: "First grow up - otherwise you cannot be seen from the ground!
         ;; I shall take a spoonful of cabbage soup and a crumb of bread and throw them in your eyes!"
         ;; The old man as big as a thumb grew more furious: "I am small but strong!"
         ;; He snatched up a crust of bread and began to beat Evening on the head with it; he beat him till he was half dead and threw him under the bench.
         ;; Then the little old man ate the roasted ram and went into the woods.
         ;; Evening tied a rag around his head and lay moaning.
         ;; The brothers returned and asked him: "What is the matter with you?"
         ;; "Eh, brothers, I made a fire in the stove, but because of the great heat I got a headache; I lay all day like one dazed, I could neither cook nor roast!"
         ;; Next day Dawn and Evening went hunting, and Midnight was left at home to prepare the dinner.
         ;; Midnight made a fire, chose the fattest ram, slaughtered it, and put it in the oven; then he lay on the bench.
         ;; Suddenly there was a rumbling noise, and the old man as big as a thumb, with a beard a cubit long, came in and began to beat and thrash him; he almost beat him to death.
         ;; Then he ate the roasted ram and went into the woods.
         ;; Midnight tied up his head with a handkerchief and lay under the bench and moaned.
         ;; The brothers returned.
         ;; "What is the matter with you?" Dawn asked him.
         ;; "I have a headache from the fumes of the stove, brothers, and I have not prepared your dinner."
         ;; On the third day the two elder brothers went hunting and Dawn stayed at home; he chose the best ram, slaughtered and cleaned it, and put it on to roast.
         ;; Then he lay on the bench.
         ;; Suddenly there was a rumbling noise - and he saw the old man as big as a thumb, with a beard a cubit long, carrying a whole hayrick on his head and holding a huge cask of water in his hand.
         ;; The little old man put down the cask of water, spread the hay over the yard, and began to count his sheep.
         ;; He saw that another ram was missing, grew angry, ran to the house, jumped at Dawn, and hit him on the head with all his strength; Dawn jumped up, grabbed the little old man by his long beard, and began to drag him around, repeating: "Look before you leap, look before you leap!"
         ;; The old man as big as a thumb, with a beard a cubit long, began to implore him: "Have pity on me, mighty champion, do not put me to death, let my soul repent!"
         ;; Dawn dragged him out into the yard, led him to an oaken pillar, and fastened his beard to the pillar with a big iron spike; then he returned to the house and sat down to wait for his brothers.
         ;; The brothers came back from their hunting and were amazed to find him safe and sound.
         ;; Dawn smiled and said: "Come with me, brothers, I have caught your fumes and fastened them to a pillar."
         ;; They went into the yard, they looked - but the old man as big as a thumb had long since run away.
         ;; But half of his beard dangled from the pillar, and blood was spattered over his tracks.
         ;; Following this clue, the brothers came to a deep hole in the ground.
         ;; Dawn went to the woods, gathered lime bast, wound a rope, and told his brothers to drop him underground.
         ;; Evening and Midnight dropped him into the hole.
         ;; He found himself in the other world, released himself from the rope, and walked straight ahead.
         ;; He walked and walked, and saw a copper castle.
         ;; He entered the castle, and the youngest princess, rosier than a pink rose, whiter than white snow, came out to meet him and asked him kindly: "How have you come here, good youth - of your own will or by compulsion?"
         ;; "Your father has sent me in search of you, princess."
         ;; She straightway seated him at the table, gave him meat and drink, and then handed him a phial with the water of strength.
         ;; "Drink of this water," she said, "and you will have added strength."
         ;; Dawn drank the phial of water and felt great power in himself.
         ;; "Now," he thought, "I can get the better of anyone."
         ;; At this moment a wild wind arose, and the princess was frightened.
         ;; "Presently," she said, "my dragon will come."
         ;; And she took Dawn by his hand and hid him in the adjoining room.
         ;; A three-headed dragon came flying, struck the damp earth, turned into a youth, and cried: "Oh, there is a Russian smell in here!
         ;; Who is visiting you?"
         ;; "Who could be here?
         ;; You have been flying over Russia and you have the Russian smell in your nostrils - that is why you fancy it is here."
         ;; The dragon asked for food and drink; the princess brought him a variety of meats and drink and poured a sleeping potion into the wine.
         ;; The dragon ate and drank his fill and was soon overwhelmed by drowsiness; he made the princess pick the lice from his hair, lay on her knees, and fell sound asleep.
         ;; The princess called Dawn.
         ;; He came forth, swung his sword, and cut off all of the dragon's three heads; then he made a bonfire, burned the foul dragon and scattered his ashes in the open field.
         ;; "Now farewell, princess!
         ;; I am going to seek your sisters; and when I have found them I shall come back for you," said Dawn, and set out.
         ;; He walked and walked, and came to a silver castle; in that castle lived the second princess.
         ;; Dawn killed a six-headed dragon there and went on.
         ;; After a long time or a short time, he reached a golden castle, and in that castle lived the eldest princess; Dawn killed a twelve-headed dragon and freed that princess from captivity.
         ;; The princess was overjoyed, made ready to return home, went out into the wide courtyard, waved a red handkerchief, and the golden kingdom rolled up into an egg; she took the egg, put it in her pocket, and went with Dawn to seek her sisters.
         ;; These princesses did the same thing: they rolled up their kingdoms into eggs, took them, and all of them went to the hole.
         ;; Evening and Midnight pulled their brother and the three princesses out into the bright world.
         ;; They all came together to their own land; the princesses rolled their eggs into the open field, and straightway three kingdoms appeared, a copper, a silver and a golden one.
         ;; The king was more overjoyed than any tongue can tell; he immediately married Dawn, Evening, and Midnight to his daughters, and at his death made Dawn his heir.
