         ;; Once upon a time, a soldier deserted from his company.
         ;; He had only a piece of bread, a knapsack and a fiddle.
         ;; One night, the fugitive soldier got lost and stumbled into a devil.
         ;; The devil approached the soldier and asked him to teach him how to play the fiddle.
         ;; The soldier taught the devil how to play.
         ;; In exchange, the devil told the soldier how to talk to the Grim Reaper.
         ;; The king's daughter had been cursed and was very ill.
         ;; The soldier went to the king and asked for a chance to help the princess.
         ;; At night, he saw the Grim Reaper enter the princess' room.
         ;; He challenged him to a game of cards.
         ;; The soldier won the game and asked the Grim Reaper to leave the princess alone as his reward.
         ;; The curse was lifted and the princess was healthy again.
