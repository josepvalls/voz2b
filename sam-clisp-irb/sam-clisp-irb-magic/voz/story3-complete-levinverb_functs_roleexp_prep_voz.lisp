         ;; An old couple lived in a hut with their adopted son.
         ;; The boy had a magical bird that could control the weather.
         ;; They used the bird's predictions to make it rain on their crops and were always prosperous.
         ;; A jealous neighbor learned about the bird.
         ;; The neighbor told the boy he needed to borrow the bird.
         ;; But the boy wouldn't let him take it.
         ;; Later, the mouse asked the boy for some food.
         ;; The kind-hearted boy gave the mouse some nuts.
         ;; Instead of eating the nuts, the mouse planted them and from them a rock sprouted from the ground.
