         ;; Her parents banished her from home until she could find a husband.

         ;; She gave her shoes to him.
         ;; The boy told her he was very grateful.
         ;; She walked until her feet bled.
         ;; The people of the kingdom ordered her to walk over hot coals.
         ;; Her feet were numb.
         ;; So she walked over the coals.

         ;; He gave the girl new garments and he fell in love with her kindness.
         ;; The prince married her and they lived happily.
