         ;; Once there was a beautiful princess.
         ;; A witch cursed her to not be happy.
         ;; The princess was very lonely.
         ;; Her father sent a call to kill the witch and lift the curse.
         ;; A naive farmer heard of the trouble.
         ;; He decided to go talk to the witch.
         ;; He left for the woods where the witch lived.
         ;; The farmer did, but that only made him hungrier.
         ;; Eventually he reached the witch's place.
         ;; The farmer met the witch and asked to lift the curse.
         ;; The witch proposed an eating contest.
         ;; The farmer was so hungry he could eat a horse.
         ;; The farmer won the contest.
         ;; When she saw him she was very happy.
         ;; They got married and lived happily ever after.
