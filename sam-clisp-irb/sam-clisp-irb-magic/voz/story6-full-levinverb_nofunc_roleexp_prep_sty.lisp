         ;; In a certain village there lived a wealthy peasant and his wife.
         ;; One day the wife went to the forest for mushrooms, lost her way, and stumbled into a bear's den.
         ;; The bear kept her with him, and after some time, a long time or a short time, she had a son by him.
         ;; This son was a man down to the waist and a bear below the waist; his mother called him Ivanko the Bearlet.
         ;; Years went by, and when Ivan grew up he wanted to go away with his mother and live with the peasants in the village; they waited until the bear went to a beehive, made ready, and ran away.
         ;; They ran and ran and finally came to their own village.
         ;; The peasant saw his wife and was overjoyed - he had given up hope that she would ever return.
         ;; Then he beheld her son and asked: "And who is this freak?"
         ;; His wife told him all that had happened, how she had lived in the bear's den and had a son by him and that this son was human to the waist and a bear from the waist down.
         ;; "Well, Bearlet," said the peasant, "go to the back yard and slaughter a sheep; we must make dinner for you."
         ;; "And which one shall I slaughter?"
         ;; "Whichever one stares at you."
         ;; Ivanko the Bearlet took a knife, went out to the yard, and called the sheep; all of them began to stare at him.
         ;; He forthwith slaughtered them all, skinned them, and went to ask the peasant where he should store the skins and the meat.
         ;; "What's this?" yelled the peasant.
         ;; "I told you to slaughter one sheep, and you have slaughtered them all!"
         ;; "No, father, you told me to slaughter whichever one stared at me; but when I came out into the yard all of them, without exception, began to stare at me."
         ;; "You certainly are a clever fellow.
         ;; Take the meat and skins into the barn, and at night guard the door against thieves and dogs."
         ;; "Very well, I will guard it."
         ;; It so happened that on that night a storm broke and the rain fell in buckets.
         ;; Ivanko the Bearlet broke the door off the barn, took it into the bath house, and spent the night there.
         ;; Thieves took advantage of the darkness; they found the barn open and without a guard, so they took whatever they pleased.
         ;; Next morning the peasant arose, went to see whether everything was in order, and found that nothing was left: what the thieves had not taken, the dogs had eaten up.
         ;; He looked for the guard, found him in the bath house, and began to chide him even more severely than the first time.
         ;; "But, father, it is not my fault," said Ivanko.
         ;; "You yourself told me to guard the door, and I did guard it.
         ;; Here it is; the thieves did not steal it, nor did the dogs eat it up."
         ;; "What can I do with this fool?" thought the peasant to himself.
         ;; "If this goes on for a month or two, he will ruin me completely.
         ;; I wonder how I can get rid of him."
         ;; Then he hit upon an idea; the next day he sent Ivanko to the lake and told him to wind ropes of sand.
         ;; Ivanko the Bearlet went to the lake, sat on the shore, and began to wind ropes of sand.
         ;; Suddenly a little devil jumped out of the water and asked: "What are you doing here, Bearlet?"
         ;; "Can't you see?
         ;; I'm winding ropes; I want to thrash the lake and torment you devils, because you live in our lake but do not pay any rent."
         ;; "Wait a while, Bearlet, I'll run and tell my grandfather," said the little devil, and - flop! - he jumped into the water.
         ;; Five minutes later he was out again and said: "Grandfather said that if you can run faster than I, we'll pay the rent; if not, he told me to drag you down into the lake."
         ;; "But you cannot hope to run faster than I.
         ;; Why, I have a grandson who was born only yesterday, and even he can outrun you.
         ;; Do you want to race with him?"
         ;; "What grandson?"
         ;; "He is lying there behind a bush," said the Bearlet, and cried to a hare, "Hey, hare, do not fail me!"
         ;; The hare darted off into the open field like mad and in a trice vanished from sight; the devil rushed after him, but it was of no use - he was half a verst behind.
         ;; "Now, if you wish," said Ivanko, "race with me.
         ;; But on one condition - if you lag behind, I will kill you."
         ;; "O no!" said the devil, and once more flopped into the water.
         ;; After a while, he jumped out, carrying his grandfather's iron crutch, and said: "Grandfather said that if you can throw this crutch higher than I can, he will pay the rent."
         ;; "Well, you throw first!"
         ;; The devil threw the crutch so high that it was hardly visible; it fell back with a terrible rumble and thrust half its length into the ground.
         ;; "Now you throw it," said the devil.
         ;; The Bearlet took the crutch in his hand and could not even move it.
         ;; "Wait a while," he said, "a cloud is coming near, I shall throw the crutch on it."
         ;; "O no, that won't do, grandfather needs his crutch!" said the little devil.
         ;; He snatched the crutch and rushed into the water.
         ;; After a while, he jumped out again, saying: "Grandfather said that if you can carry this horse around the lake at least one more time than I can, he will pay the rent; if not, you will have to go into the lake."
         ;; "Is that supposed to be hard?
         ;; All right, begin!" answered Ivanko.
         ;; The devil heaved the horse on to his back and dragged it around the lake; he carried it ten times, till he was exhausted and sweat streamed down his snout.
         ;; "Well, now it's my turn," said Ivanko.
         ;; He mounted the horse and began to ride around the lake; he rode so long that finally the horse collapsed under him.
         ;; "Well, brother, how was that?" he asked the little devil.
         ;; "I must admit," said the devil, "that you carried it more times than I, and in what a strange fashion!
         ;; Between your legs!
         ;; That way I couldn't have carried it even once!
         ;; How much rent must we pay?"
         ;; "Just fill my hat with gold, and work for a year as my laborer - that's all I want."
         ;; The little devil ran to fetch the gold; Ivanko cut the bottom out of his hat and placed it above a deep pit; the devil kept bringing gold and pouring it into the hat.
         ;; He worked at this for a whole day and only by evening was the hat filled.
         ;; Here is a laborer for you, and gold too."
