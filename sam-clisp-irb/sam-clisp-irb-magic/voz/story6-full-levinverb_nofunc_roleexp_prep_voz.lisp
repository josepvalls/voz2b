         ;; Once upon a time, in a land, far, far away.
         ;; There lived a girl with her baby brother and her mother.
         ;; One day, the mother went to the market.
         ;; The mother told the girl to watch her baby brother.
         ;; The girl started playing and soon forgot what her mother had asked her.
         ;; After a while, the girl came back and realized her baby brother was missing.
         ;; The girl suspected the witch may be behind.
         ;; She decided to go save her brother and went on to the witch's hut.
         ;; She made her way in and waited for the witch.
         ;; The bear asked the girl for food.
         ;; The girl prepared some porridge and fed it to the bear.
         ;; The bear told the girl he would fight the witch in return.
         ;; Then a little mouse came from a little hole in the wall.
         ;; The mouse asked the girl what she was doing there.
         ;; The girl told the mouse about her missing baby brother.
         ;; The mouse told her that a little boy was being kept captive in a cellar under the hut.
         ;; The girl found a trap door leading to the cellar where she met her brother.
         ;; The girl pulled her brother from the cellar and escaped.
