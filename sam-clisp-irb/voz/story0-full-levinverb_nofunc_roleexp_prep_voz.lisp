         ;; Once upon a time, a family lived in the countryside in their farm.
         ;; Their son was a simpleton.
         ;; The crops wouldn't grow anymore and the family was starving.
         ;; The son decided to chase the witch.
         ;; The son ran to the faint sunlight and caught the witch.
         ;; The witch flung rocks at him.
         ;; He flung the rocks back at the witch and a big one hit her bag.
         ;; Out of the witch's bag came out the sun.
         ;; The witch transformed into a beautiful lady.
         ;; Then she chased the son and tried to entice him to go with her.
         ;; The magical hat showed the son the witch's true intentions.
         ;; He escaped the witch and got home safe and sound.
