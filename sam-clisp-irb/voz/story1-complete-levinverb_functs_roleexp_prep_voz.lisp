         ;; A poor mother lived in a little house with her two sons.
         ;; There was famine and she could barely feed her sons.
         ;; One day a hungry snake walked nearby.
         ;; The snake looked through the window and saw the younger son unattended.
         ;; The mother saw her younger son missing.
         ;; She asked her older son to go look for his younger brother.
         ;; The older brother was very responsible and agreed.
         ;; He left the house and went into the woods.
