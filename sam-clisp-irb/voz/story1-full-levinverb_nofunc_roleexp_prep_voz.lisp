         ;; A poor mother lived in a little house with her two sons.
         ;; There was famine and she could barely feed her sons.
         ;; One day a hungry snake walked nearby.
         ;; The snake looked through the window and saw the younger son unattended.
         ;; The mother saw her younger son missing.
         ;; She asked her older son to go look for his younger brother.
         ;; The older brother was very responsible and agreed.
         ;; He left the house and went into the woods.
         ;; The snake's wife asked him to go into her burrow.
         ;; The older brother agreed.
         ;; As soon as the snake's wife turned around he struck her and killed her.
         ;; He went into the snake's burrow.
         ;; Inside he ate the snake's eggs.
         ;; The snake came out of the deeper part of the burrow.
         ;; The snake saw his eggs missing and died of sadness.
         ;; The older brother now was well fed.
         ;; They arrived home safely.
         ;; As a strong and healthy man, the older brother quickly found a bride.
