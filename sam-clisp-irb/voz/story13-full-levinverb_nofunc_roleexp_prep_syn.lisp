         ;; There was a giant who had been terrorizing the village's folks.
         ;; The gypsy met an old man.
         ;; The old man told him all about the giant.
         ;; The gypsy told the old man he would take care of the giant.
         ;; He grabbed a piece of soft cheese and went to meet the giant.
         ;; The giant smashed a rock with his hands.
         ;; The gypsy took the cheese and told the giant it was a rock.
