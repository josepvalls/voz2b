         ;; A poor laborer lived in a small town.
         ;; His master's crops had been ruined and there was no work for him.

         ;; The laborer was very understanding.
         ;; The bull challenged him to a race.
         ;; The laborer agreed and the bull stormed out.
         ;; The laborer knew the land really well and instead of following the path he took a shortcut.

         ;; Ashamed, the bull promised to stop running and ruining the crops.
         ;; The laborer was able to find work in no time and was prosperous.
