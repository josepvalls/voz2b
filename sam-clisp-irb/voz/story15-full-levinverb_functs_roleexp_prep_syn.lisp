         ;; A woman was once kidnapped by a bear.
         ;; The woman gave birth to a bearlet who was half-boy and half-bear.
         ;; Eventually, the woman was able to escape and took the boy with her.
         ;; He had a plan to get rid of the bearlet.
         ;; He told the bearlet that he would only let him stay if he got rid of the water spirits in the lake.
         ;; The bearlet left not knowing what to do.
         ;; The water spirit challenged him to see who could scream the loudest.
         ;; The bearlet and the water spirit took turns yelling and screaming.
         ;; The bearlet asked the water spirit to close his eyes.
         ;; Then, the bearlet smacked his head with a stick.
         ;; The water spirit thought that the bearlet's scream had shaken his head and gave up.
         ;; The water spirit conceded to the bearlet and went to live to another lake.
