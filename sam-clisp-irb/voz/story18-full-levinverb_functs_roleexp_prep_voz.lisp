         ;; There once lived a poor and unlucky peasant.
         ;; He never married and was very lonely.
         ;; A fox came to him one day and told him that he could marry him to the princess.
         ;; The peasant was reluctant but then trusted the fox.
         ;; They emerged from the swamp covered in mud.
         ;; A nearby water spirit was so scared when they saw them that died instantly.
         ;; Then, the fox told the king that the peasant was a prince and that his clothes had been lost fighting the water spirit.
         ;; The king was impressed by their feat and gave the peasant new clothes and jewelry.
         ;; Then the peasant married the princess and became a prince.
         ;; Satisfied with her deed, the fox returned home.
