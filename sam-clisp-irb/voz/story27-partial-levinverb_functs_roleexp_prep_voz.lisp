         ;; A family with a son and a daughter lived in a faraway land.
         ;; One day the parents sent the son to work their fields.
         ;; The brother asked his sister to bring him lunch later.
         ;; He told her to follow the trail with his footprints.
         ;; A witch overheard the conversation.
         ;; The witch then erased the brother's footprints and put her own on a path to her hut.
         ;; Later that day, when lunch was ready, the girl's mother asked her to bring it to her brother.
         ;; The girl left and followed the path with the footprints and got to the witch's hut.
