         ;; A poor traveling gypsy and his son got lost in the woods.
         ;; Late at night they found a tower and asked for help.
         ;; A little frog let them in.
         ;; The frog told them that they could stay the night but asked them not to go upstairs.
         ;; In the middle of the night, they heard noise upstairs and went to check it out.
         ;; There was a witch.
         ;; She converted the father into a lizard.
         ;; The boy agreed but the witch was too fast and he couldn't get her hat.
