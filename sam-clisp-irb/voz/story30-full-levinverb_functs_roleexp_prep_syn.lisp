         ;; Once upon a time, a family lived in an isolated mountain.
         ;; They had a son and a daughter.
         ;; The daughter was very miserable and cried day and night.
         ;; The son decided he had to free his sister.
         ;; His father surprised him as he was opening the door.
         ;; He told him, he'd let him free his sister if he'd win a game of cards with him.
         ;; The boy was very skilled at card games and won.

         ;; He was so mad that he wanted to eat them both.
         ;; The mother saw what was going on.
         ;; He tripped her husband and he fell down the mountain and died.
