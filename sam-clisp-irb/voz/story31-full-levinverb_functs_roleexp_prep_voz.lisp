         ;; Then the melon would point in the right direction to find her baby.
         ;; The mother did and the melon pointed towards a food stand.
         ;; There, the mother found the widow and confronted her.
         ;; The widow claimed the baby was hers.
         ;; To prove, a passerby suggested the two women should guess the baby's weight in a set of nearby scales.
         ;; The widow tried to balance the scales but she couldn't.
         ;; The mother then, placed the melon in one of the scales and the baby in the other and they balanced perfectly.
         ;; The widow was expelled from town and never seen again.
