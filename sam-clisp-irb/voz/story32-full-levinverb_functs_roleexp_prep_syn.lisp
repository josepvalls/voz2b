         ;; A girl lived with her parents.
         ;; She was beautiful but could not find a suitable husband.
         ;; Her parents banished her from home until she could find a husband.
         ;; She walked for a very long time.
         ;; She ran into a poor boy who had no shoes.
         ;; She gave her shoes to him.
         ;; The boy told her he was very grateful.
         ;; She walked until her feet bled.
         ;; She eventually reached a new kingdom.
         ;; The people of the kingdom ordered her to walk over hot coals.
         ;; Her feet were numb.
         ;; So she walked over the coals.
         ;; The little boy saw the girl.
         ;; He went to fetch the prince of the kingdom and asked for his help.
         ;; The prince saw how the girl has been mistreated.
         ;; He gave the girl new garments and he fell in love with her kindness.
         ;; The prince married her and they lived happily.
