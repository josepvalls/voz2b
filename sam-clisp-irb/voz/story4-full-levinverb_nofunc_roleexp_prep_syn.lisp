         ;; Once upon a time there lived an old widow without any children.
         ;; A witch told her she would give her a child if the woman would return the child on his second birthday.
         ;; The woman agreed and became pregnant and gave birth to a boy.
         ;; The witch came the next day but could not find the boy.
         ;; The witch cursed the boy and transformed him into a cat.
         ;; Years passed and everyday the mother would sing to the cat and tell him about his story.
         ;; One day the cat decided he could no longer bear his mother's sadness and decided to leave.
         ;; The cat left the house and boarded a ship.
         ;; His mother wouldn't recognize him and locked him out.
         ;; The other cat was the witch's in disguise.
         ;; The witch asked the mother to kill the boy.
         ;; The boy had to prove to her mother that he was his son.
         ;; He sang the song her mother used to sing to him.
         ;; The mother then realized who her son really was.
         ;; She took a shovel and killed the witch.
         ;; At this moment the spell broke and the boy regained his human form.
         ;; He was a good looking lad that had no trouble finding a wife.
