         ;; There lived a girl with her baby brother and her mother.

         ;; The mother told the girl to watch her brother.
         ;; The girl started playing and soon forgot what her mother had asked her.
         ;; When the girl could not find her brother home, she became concerned and left looking for him.
         ;; The tree asked the girl to eat one of her apples before telling her where her brother was.
         ;; The girl refused to eat an apple and the tree did not tell her.
         ;; The girl continued looking for her brother and eventually followed a little path that led to a wicked little cabin.
         ;; The girl saw her brother inside.
         ;; The girl grabbed her brother and ran away.
         ;; The witch saw the girl running and started chasing after them.
         ;; The girl ran into the magic apple tree and asked for help.
         ;; The apple tree asked the girl to eat an apple.
         ;; The girl ate an apple.
         ;; Then, the apple tree hid her under her branches.
         ;; The witch passed by and did not see the girl.
