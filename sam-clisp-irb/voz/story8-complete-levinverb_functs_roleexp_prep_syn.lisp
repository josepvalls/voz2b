         ;; Once upon a time there was a happy queen with a son and a daughter.
         ;; In the kingdom lived a witch that was jealous of their happiness.
         ;; The witch devised a plan to ruin their family.
         ;; The witch visited them.
         ;; She gave the prince a ring and told him that he would be happy as long as he married a girl who the ring would fit.
         ;; One day, his sister saw the ring and tried it on.
         ;; The ring fit perfectly and she couldn't take it off.
         ;; He immediately asked her to marry him.
         ;; The girl panicked and escaped the palace.
