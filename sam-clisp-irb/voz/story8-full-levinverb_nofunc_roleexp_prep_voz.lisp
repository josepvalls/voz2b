         ;; Once upon a time there was a happy queen with a son and a daughter.
         ;; In the kingdom lived a witch that was jealous of their happiness.
         ;; The witch devised a plan to ruin their family.
         ;; The witch visited them.
         ;; She gave the prince a ring and told him that he would be happy as long as he married a girl who the ring would fit.
         ;; One day, his sister saw the ring and tried it on.
         ;; The ring fit perfectly and she couldn't take it off.
         ;; He immediately asked her to marry him.
         ;; The girl panicked and escaped the palace.
         ;; She walked though the forest until she reached a lonely hut.
         ;; Inside there was a maiden.
         ;; The maiden was the daughter of a witch.
         ;; The maiden was lonely and asked the girl to be friends.
         ;; They talked for hours.
         ;; The next day the maiden asked the girl for help braiding a handkerchief.
         ;; The girl agreed.
         ;; Together they braided a beautiful handkerchief.
         ;; The maiden asked the girl to keep it as a token of their friendship.
         ;; Then the witch appeared from the sky.
         ;; The witch smelled the girl and wanted to eat her.
         ;; The maiden hid the girl from the witch.
         ;; When she couldn't find her, the witch left and the girl escaped safely.
         ;; The girl arrived home and found her brother sobbing in her absence.
         ;; Her brother apologized to her for his behavior.
         ;; Eventually both the brother and sister married royalty from neighboring kingdoms and were happy ever after.
