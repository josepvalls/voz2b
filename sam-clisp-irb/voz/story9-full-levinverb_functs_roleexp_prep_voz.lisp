         ;; Once there lived a rich merchant with a beautiful daughter.
         ;; The merchant sent her daughter to marry the kingdom's prince.
         ;; The daughter parted with a maidservant.
         ;; The maidservant stole the merchant's daughter clothes and left her to be eaten by the wolves.
         ;; The prince was confused because of the lack of manners of the maidservant but married her anyway.
         ;; Meanwhile, a fairy found the merchant's daughter, took pity on her and gave her a pair of magic eyes.
         ;; When the maidservant learned about the merchant's daughter still being alive was furious.
         ;; She asked the prince to go to the palace's doors and kill the merchant's daughter.
         ;; The merchant's daughter gave the magic eyes to the prince.
         ;; The prince saw the maidservant through the magic eyes.
         ;; He saw the horrible creature that she was in the inside.
         ;; The prince ordered the maidservant to be expelled from the palace.
         ;; The maidservant enraged and chased the merchant's daughter to kill her.
         ;; The maidservant cornered the merchant's daughter at the edge of a cliff.
         ;; The fairy converted the merchant's daughter into a dove and she escaped.
         ;; The maidservant fell off the cliff and died.
         ;; The dove flow back to the palace where she converted into a beautiful girl again.
         ;; The prince married her and they lived happily the rest of their lives.
