         ;; A pale splash surfaced beyond the border of orange buoys.
         ;;  It flailed and Julian could tell someone was struggling to rise above the water.
         ;;   He sounded his megaphone and jumped from a bleached wooden tower.
         ;;  This was his first incident as lifeguard, but he knew what he had to do.
         ;;  He grabbed a lifesaver as he hit the sand.
         ;;  People on the beach cleared a path.
         ;;  The only sounds heard were the seagulls? caws and the tide rushing in recession from the coast.
         ;; The water was cold.
         ;;  Julian reached the buoy where he saw the splash.
         ;;  He re-fastened his goggles, secured the lifesaver to the buoy, and breathed deeply just before he dove into the depths of the salty waters.
         ;;   As his eyes adjusted to the dying light, he saw a boy sinking slowly.
         ;; He dived downwards;
         ;;  the current sent sudden rushes of coldness down his body.
         ;;  Undeterred by the cold current and the sweeping haze of the sea, Julian reached the boy?s arm just in time and pulled him to the surface.
         ;;  Returning to the shore, the boy gasped for air in exhaustion and desperation.
         ;;  Julian's eyes.
         ;;  Julian's body.
         ;;  Current is cold.
         ;;  Boy's arm.
