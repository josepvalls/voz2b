         ;; The night his father died, Julian sat in his study silently.
         ;;  He had planned to approach him with Vivian and convince him to go to the hospital.
         ;; He looked at the dusty half-empty bottle of bourbon on the desk.
         ;;  He found that bottle on the basement floor a few days ago while looking for an old book for his father.
         ;;  His hand reached toward the bottle.
         ;;  Julian wanted to pull his arm away, but his hand opened it instead.
         ;; He wanted to resist as the bourbon?s stench hit his nostrils.
         ;;  He wanted to spit out the alcohol as it burned his throat.
         ;;  He wanted to, but he couldn?t. Julian sighed, poured a second glass.
         ;;  Julian's silence.
         ;;  Bottle is old.
         ;;  Bottle has alcohol.
