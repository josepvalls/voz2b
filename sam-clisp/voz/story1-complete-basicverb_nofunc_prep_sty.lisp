         ;; A dragon appeared near Kiev; he took heavy tribute from the people - a lovely maiden from every house, whom he then devoured.
         ;; Finally, it was the fate of the tsar's daughter to go to the dragon.
         ;; He seized her and dragged her to his lair but did not devour her, because she was a beauty.
         ;; Instead, he took her to wife.
         ;; Whenever he went out, he boarded up his house to prevent the princess from escaping.
         ;; The princess had a little dog that had followed her to the dragon's lair.
         ;; The princess often wrote to her father and mother.
         ;; She would attach her letter to the dog's neck, and the dog would take it to them and even bring back the answer.
         ;; One day the tsar and tsarina wrote to their daughter, asking her to find out who in this world was stronger than the dragon.
         ;; The princess became kindlier toward the dragon and began to question him.
         ;; For a long time he did not answer, but one day he said inadvertently that a tanner in the city of Kiev was stronger than he.
         ;; When the princess heard this, she wrote her father to find Nikita the Tanner in Kiev and to send him to deliver her from captivity.
         ;; Upon receiving this letter, the tsar went in person to beg Nikita the Tanner to free his land from the wicked dragon and rescue the princess.
         ;; But no matter how much the tsar and tsarina entreated him, he refused to go forth against the dragon.
         ;; So they gathered together five thousand little children and sent them to implore him, hoping that their tears would move him to pity.
         ;; The little children came to Nikita and begged him with tears to go fight the dragon.
         ;; Nikita himself began to shed tears when he saw theirs.
         ;; He took twelve thousand pounds of hemp, tarred it with pitch, and wound it around himself so that the dragon could not devour him, then went forth to give him battle.
         ;; Nikita came to the dragon's lair but the dragon locked himself in.
         ;; "Better come out into the open field," said Nikita, "or I will destroy your lair together with you!"
         ;; And he began to break down the door.
         ;; The dragon, seeing that he could not avoid trouble, went out to fight in the open field.
         ;; Nikita fought him for a long time or a short time; in any event, he defeated him.
         ;; Then the dragon began to implore Nikita: "Do not put me to death, Nikita the Tanner; no one in the world is stronger than you and I.
         ;; Let us divide all the earth, all the world, into equal parts; you shall live in one half, I in the other."
         ;; "Very well," said Nikita, "let us draw a boundary line."
         ;; He made a plow that weighed twelve thousand pounds, harnessed the dragon to it, and the dragon began to plow a boundary from Kiev; he plowed a furrow from Kiev to the Caspian Sea.
         ;; "Now," said the dragon, "we have divided the whole earth."
         ;; "We have divided the earth," said Nikita, "now let us divide the sea; else you will say that your water has been taken."
         ;; The dragon crawled to the middle of the sea; Nikita killed him and drowned him in the sea.
         ;; That furrow can be seen to this very day; it is fourteen feet high.
         ;; Around it the fields are plowed, but the furrow is intact; and those who do not know what it is, call it the rampart.
