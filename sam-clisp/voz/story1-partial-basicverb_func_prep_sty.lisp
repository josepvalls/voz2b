         ;; A dragon appeared near Kiev; he took heavy tribute from the people - a lovely maiden from every house, whom he then devoured.
         ;; Finally, it was the fate of the tsar's daughter to go to the dragon.
         ;; He seized her and dragged her to his lair but did not devour her, because she was a beauty.
         ;; Instead, he took her to wife.
         ;; Whenever he went out, he boarded up his house to prevent the princess from escaping.
         ;; The princess had a little dog that had followed her to the dragon's lair.
         ;; The princess often wrote to her father and mother.
         ;; She would attach her letter to the dog's neck, and the dog would take it to them and even bring back the answer.
         ;; One day the tsar and tsarina wrote to their daughter, asking her to find out who in this world was stronger than the dragon.
         ;; The princess became kindlier toward the dragon and began to question him.
         ;; For a long time he did not answer, but one day he said inadvertently that a tanner in the city of Kiev was stronger than he.
         ;; When the princess heard this, she wrote her father to find Nikita the Tanner in Kiev and to send him to deliver her from captivity.
         ;; Upon receiving this letter, the tsar went in person to beg Nikita the Tanner to free his land from the wicked dragon and rescue the princess.
