         ;; Once, in a far away land, there was a man who had seven sons - all by the name of Simeon.
         ;; They were seven lazy, good-for-nothing loafers.
         ;; The laziest sons anyone ever had anywhere!
         ;; They never did a single useful thing.
         ;; This was unbearable for their father.
         ;; Eventually, it got to the point that he simply brought all seven Simeons to the czar and enlisted them in his service.
         ;; The czar was grateful to the father for bringing him so many fine, able men.
         ;; He asked the father about their skills, "What do they know how to do?"
         ;; "Ask them yourself, your royal majesty," their father said.
         ;; Accordingly, the czar summoned the oldest Simeon and asked him, "What is your trade?"
         ;; "Thievery, your royal majesty."
         ;; "Hmm, you will probably be valuable to me at some point."
         ;; He called in the second, "And what about you?"
         ;; "I'm an artisan; I can make anything valuable."
         ;; "You will also be useful."
         ;; He called in the third Simeon, asking: "And what can you do?"
         ;; "I can shoot any bird - even in flight, your royal majesty."
         ;; "Great!" said the czar.
         ;; He asks the fourth, "And you?"
         ;; "If a marksman shoots a bird, I will retrieve it, better than any dog."
         ;; "Fine!"
         ;; "And what are you proficient at?" he asked the fifth.
         ;; "From a vantage point, I can see and then relate all that is happening in any part of the kingdom."
         ;; "Sounds great!"
         ;; After the fifth Simeon, he questioned the sixth.
         ;; "I'm very good at building boats; for me it's 'slam-bam,' and I've built a boat."
         ;; "Good."
         ;; Then asking the seventh, "And what do you do?"
         ;; "I am a healer."
         ;; "Sounds good." said the czar.
         ;; Then he dismissed them all.
         ;; After some time passed, the czar remembering the seven Simeons, decided to put one of their skills to use.
         ;; The king asked the fifth Simeon, "Okay, Simeon, will you find out what is going on in various places?"
         ;; Simeon climbed to a high place, looked around and related, "Here such-and-such is happening, and there, such-and-such."
         ;; They checked his statements with the newspapers and found he was exactly right!
         ;; After another long period passed, the czar decided to marry a certain princess.
         ;; He just didn't know; there was no one suitable for the job.
         ;; Then he remembered the seven Simeons.
         ;; Summoning them, he commissioned them as soldiers, with the assignment to bring him that princess.
         ;; As expert craftsmen they, slam-bam, built a boat, boarded and sailed off to the kingdom of the bride-to-be-princess.
         ;; The maker of valuables went with his brother, the thief, to sell his wares in the palace.
         ;; They barely arrived when the thief stole the princess.
         ;; They immediately cut anchor and set sail.
         ;; When the princess realized they were carrying her away, she turned into a white swan and flew from the boat.
         ;; The marksman, without delay, grabbed his gun and fired a shot into her left wing.
         ;; Simeon number four darted into the water, retrieved the swan, as any good dog would, bringing her back to the boat.
         ;; The swan turned back into a princess, but her left arm was still injured.
         ;; Healer Simeon immediately cured the princess' arm.
         ;; With their healthy and successful return to their own kingdom, the Simeons fired a round from the cannon.
         ;; The czar heard it, but had already forgotten about the Simeons.
         ;; He thought to himself, "What's going on with that boat out there?"
         ;; "Please go," he said.
         ;; "Run and find out what's going on."
         ;; Whether somebody ran or rode, they quickly returned with news concerning the seven Simeons and the czar's future bride.
         ;; The czar rejoiced in the Simeons' success and commanded they be met with honor, cannon-fire, and the beating of drums.
         ;; Only the princess didn't want marry the czar.
         ;; He was already too old!
         ;; Therefore, he asked her who she wanted to marry.
         ;; The princess answered, "I want to marry the man who kidnapped me!"
         ;; Afterall, the thief was a dashing fellow whose nobility appealed to the princess.
         ;; The czar, without another word, ordered them to be married.
         ;; Years later, he wanted some peace and quiet, so he placed Simeon the Thief on the throne, and made all of his brothers great noblemen.
