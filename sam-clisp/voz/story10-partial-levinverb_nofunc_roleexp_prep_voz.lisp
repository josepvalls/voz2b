         ;; Once, in a far away land, there was a man who had seven sons - all by the name of Simeon.
         ;; They were seven lazy, good-for-nothing loafers.
         ;; The laziest sons anyone ever had anywhere!
         ;; They never did a single useful thing.
         ;; This was unbearable for their father.
         ;; Eventually, it got to the point that he simply brought all seven Simeons to the czar and enlisted them in his service.
         ;; The czar was grateful to the father for bringing him so many fine, able men.
         ;; He asked the father about their skills, "What do they know how to do?"
         ;; "Ask them yourself, your royal majesty," their father said.
         ;; Accordingly, the czar summoned the oldest Simeon and asked him, "What is your trade?"
         ;; "Thievery, your royal majesty."
         ;; "Hmm, you will probably be valuable to me at some point."
         ;; He called in the second, "And what about you?"
         ;; "I'm an artisan; I can make anything valuable."
         ;; "You will also be useful."
         ;; He called in the third Simeon, asking: "And what can you do?"
         ;; "I can shoot any bird - even in flight, your royal majesty."
         ;; "Great!" said the czar.
         ;; He asks the fourth, "And you?"
         ;; "If a marksman shoots a bird, I will retrieve it, better than any dog."
         ;; "Fine!"
         ;; "And what are you proficient at?" he asked the fifth.
         ;; "From a vantage point, I can see and then relate all that is happening in any part of the kingdom."
         ;; "Sounds great!"
         ;; After the fifth Simeon, he questioned the sixth.
         ;; "I'm very good at building boats; for me it's 'slam-bam,' and I've built a boat."
         ;; "Good."
         ;; Then asking the seventh, "And what do you do?"
         ;; "I am a healer."
         ;; "Sounds good." said the czar.
         ;; Then he dismissed them all.
         ;; After some time passed, the czar remembering the seven Simeons, decided to put one of their skills to use.
         ;; The king asked the fifth Simeon, "Okay, Simeon, will you find out what is going on in various places?"
         ;; Simeon climbed to a high place, looked around and related, "Here such-and-such is happening, and there, such-and-such."
         ;; They checked his statements with the newspapers and found he was exactly right!
         ;; After another long period passed, the czar decided to marry a certain princess.
