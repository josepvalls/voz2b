         ;; Once upon a time there was an old couple, and they had three Sons.
         ;; Two of these had their wits about them, but the third was a simpleton, Ivan by name, surnamed Popyalof.
         ;; For twelve whole years Ivan lay among the ashes from the stove; but then he arose, and shook himself, so that six poods of ashes fell off from him.
         ;; Now in the land in which Ivan lived there was never any day, but always night.
         ;; That was a Snake's doing.
         ;; Well, Ivan undertook to kill that Snake, so he said to his father, "Father make me a mace five poods in weight."
         ;; The next day he went out into the fields to the spot from which he had flung the mace on high, and stood there with his head thrown back.
         ;; So when the mace fell down again it hit him on the forehead.
         ;; And the mace broke in two.
         ;; Ivan went home and said to his father, "Father, make me another mace, a ten pood one."
         ;; And when he had got it he went out into the fields, and flung it aloft.
         ;; And the mace went flying through the air for three days and three nights.
         ;; On the fourth day Ivan went out to the same spot, and when the mace came tumbling down, he put his knee in the way, and the mace broke over it into three pieces.
         ;; Ivan went home and told his father to make him a third mace, one of fifteen poods weight.
         ;; And when he had got it, he went out into the fields and flung it aloft.
         ;; And the mace was up in the air six days.
         ;; On the seventh Ivan went to the same spot as before.
         ;; Down fell the mace, and when it struck Ivan's forehead, the forehead bowed under it.
         ;; Thereupon he said, "This mace will do for the Snake!"
         ;; So when he had got everything ready, he went forth with his brothers to fight the Snake.
         ;; He rode and rode, and presently there stood before him a hut on fowl's legs, and in that hut lived the Snake.
         ;; There all the party came to a standstill.
         ;; Then Ivan hung up his gloves, and said to his brothers, "Should blood drop from my gloves, make haste to help me."
         ;; When he had said this he went into the hut and sat down under the boarding.
         ;; Presently there rode up a Snake with three heads.
         ;; His steed stumbled, his hound howled, his falcon clamored.
         ;; Then cried the Snake: "Wherefore hast thou stumbled, O Steed! hast thou howled, O Hound! hast thou clamored, O Falcon?"
         ;; "How can I but stumble," replied the Steed, "when under the boarding sits Ivan Popyalof?"
         ;; Then said the Snake, "Come forth, Ivanushka!
         ;; Let us try our strength together."
         ;; Ivan came forth, and they began to fight.
