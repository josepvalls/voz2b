         ;; Once upon a time there was an old couple, and they had three Sons.
         ;; Two of these had their wits about them, but the third was a simpleton, Ivan by name, surnamed Popyalof.
         ;; For twelve whole years Ivan lay among the ashes from the stove; but then he arose, and shook himself, so that six poods of ashes fell off from him.
         ;; Now in the land in which Ivan lived there was never any day, but always night.
         ;; That was a Snake's doing.
         ;; Well, Ivan undertook to kill that Snake, so he said to his father, "Father make me a mace five poods in weight."
