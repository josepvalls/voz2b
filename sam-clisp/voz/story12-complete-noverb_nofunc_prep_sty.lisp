         ;; In old times there was a village where a serpent frequently flew.
         ;; He had devoured all but one of the villagers.
         ;; At that time a gypsy came to the village.
         ;; He came at night and no matter where he looked, he couldn't find anyone!
         ;; He finally entered the last hut where the last man was sitting and crying.
         ;; "Greetings, good man!"
         ;; "Why are you here, gypsy?
         ;; Surely, you must be tired of life."
         ;; "Why do you say that?"
         ;; He has eaten everyone.
         ;; He only left me alone until tomorrow morning when he will fly back and devour me too.
         ;; In fact, he won't spare you either!
         ;; He'll eat us both in one sitting!"
         ;; "Or maybe he'll choke!
         ;; Why don't you let me sleep here tonight?
         ;; Tomorrow I'll see what kind of serpent this is."
         ;; So, they spent the night.
         ;; The next morning, a strong windstorm suddenly arose.
         ;; The hut shook when the serpent landed.
         ;; "Aha," said the serpent, "I've already turned a profit!
         ;; I left only one man, but now I have two.
         ;; Now I'll have something for lunch as well!"
         ;; "Do you really think you can eat us?" asked the gypsy.
         ;; "Yes, indeed, I will eat you."
         ;; "You lie, devilish fiend.
         ;; You will choke!"
         ;; "So then, you think you are stronger than me?"
         ;; "I should say so!
         ;; I think even you realize I have greater strength than you."
         ;; "Well then, let's just see who's stronger between the two of us."
         ;; "Let's!"
         ;; The serpent grabbed a millstone.
         ;; "Look at this, gypsy!
         ;; I will crush this stone with only one hand."
         ;; "Fine!
         ;; I'll watch."
         ;; The serpent grabbed the stone with the palm of his hand and squeezed it so tightly that it turned into fine sand - a cloud of dust arose from his fist.
         ;; "What a wonder," said the gypsy, "but try gripping a rock so hard that water comes out of it.
         ;; Watch how I squeeze!"
         ;; There was a chunk of cheese curd on the table, the gypsy grabbed it and really gave it a squeeze.
         ;; Whey dripped out onto the ground.
         ;; "Well, did you see that?
         ;; So who's stronger?"
         ;; "True, your hand is stronger than my own.
         ;; Let's see who can whistle the loudest."
         ;; "Well, whistle!"
         ;; The serpent whistled so loudly that leaves fell from all the trees.
         ;; "You whistle very well, brother, but still not as well as I," said the gypsy.
         ;; "First, you had better protect your eyeballs, or else they'll pop right out of your head!"
         ;; The serpent believed it and covered his eyes with a scarf.
         ;; "Okay, go ahead and whistle."
         ;; The gypsy grabbed a club and as he whistled he thumped the serpent, who yelled at the top of his voice, "That's enough!
         ;; That's enough, gypsy!
         ;; Don't whistle anymore!
         ;; In one go, my eyes have almost come right out."
         ;; "Alright, however, I am quite prepared to whistle some more."
         ;; "No, no, you don't need to do that.
         ;; I don't want to argue with you anymore.
         ;; Better yet, let's become brothers.
         ;; You be the older brother, and I'll be the younger."
         ;; "Agreed!"
         ;; "Well, brother," said the serpent, "if you please, out there in the meadow a herd of oxen is grazing.
         ;; Pick out the fattest, grab it by the tail and drag it back for lunch."
         ;; There was nothing to be done - the gypsy went to the meadow.
         ;; He saw a large herd of oxen grazing.
         ;; He started to tie them together by their tails.
         ;; The serpent waited and waited and couldn't wait any longer.
         ;; He ran out to the meadow to see what was going on.
         ;; "What is taking so long?"
         ;; "Just wait a little longer.
         ;; I'm tying together around fifty of these.
         ;; Then in one trip I can drag them all back home so that we'll have enough for a whole month!"
         ;; "Oh, you!
         ;; Why do we need to spend our whole lives here?
         ;; One is enough."
         ;; Then the serpent grabbed the biggest oxen by the tale, ripped off the hide, shouldered the meat and dragged it home.
         ;; "Brother, what about all the animals I tied together?
         ;; We're not going to just leave them?"
         ;; "Forget them."
         ;; They returned to the hut, and set up two cauldrons for the beef, but there was no water.
         ;; "Here, take this ox-hide," said the serpent to the gypsy, "if you please, fill this up with water and carry it back here.
         ;; We'll start boiling our lunch."
         ;; The gypsy grabbed the hide and dragged it to the well.
         ;; Completely empty he could barely drag it, to say nothing of it when filled with water.
         ;; He got to the well and started to dig a deep trench around it.
         ;; The serpent again waited and waited and couldn't wait any longer.
         ;; He ran out to see for himself what was taking so long.
         ;; "What are you doing, brother?"
         ;; "I want to dig all the way around the well and then drag the whole well back to the hut, so that you won't have to go out for water anymore."
         ;; "Oh, you!
         ;; You're trying to do too much.
         ;; To dig out the well would take a long time."
         ;; The serpent dropped the hide into the well, filled it with water, dragged it out and carried it home.
         ;; "Brother," he said to the gypsy, "go into the forest.
         ;; Choose a dry oak and pull it to the hut.
         ;; It's time to start a fire!"
         ;; The gypsy went into the forest and pulled out bark fiber to twist into a rope.
         ;; He braided an extremely long rope and set to wrapping up the oak trees.
         ;; The serpent waited and waited and couldn't wait any longer.
         ;; He ran out to see for himself what was taking so long.
         ;; "Why are you dilly-dallying?"
         ;; "Well, I want to bring in twenty oaks at once by tying them together and then dragging them in, roots and all, so that you will have firewood for a long time!"
         ;; "Oh, you!
         ;; You do everything your own way," said the serpent, then he ripped out the widest oak with its roots and dragged it to the hut.
         ;; The gypsy pretended like he was extremely angry.
         ;; Pouting, he sat silently.
         ;; The serpent cooked the beef, and called the gypsy to lunch.
         ;; But the gypsy fervently replied, "I don't want to!"
         ;; And so the serpent scarfed a whole ox, drank a whole oxen-skin of water and then questioned the gypsy, "Tell me, brother, why are you upset?"
         ;; "Because whatever I do, it's just not right.
         ;; It's not how you like it done!"
         ;; "Well, don't be angry.
         ;; Let's make peace!"
         ;; "If you want to make peace with me, then visit me as my guest."
         ;; "Please, I'm ready now, brother!"
         ;; Right away, the serpent got his wagon, harnessed three of the best stallions, and they left together for the gypsy camp.
         ;; Barely dressed, they ran to meet him.
         ;; At the top of their voices they exclaimed, "Father has arrived!
         ;; He brought a serpent!"
         ;; The serpent became frightened and asked the gypsy, "Who are they?"
         ;; "Those are my children!
         ;; I suppose they are hungry right now.
         ;; Look how greedily they are coming for you."
         ;; The serpent jumped out of the wagon and ran away.
         ;; The gypsy sold the trio of horses with the wagon and began to live the good life.
