         ;; There was once an old princess; she had a son and a daughter, both well built, both handsome.
         ;; A wicked witch disliked them; she pondered and pondered as to how she could lead them into evil ways and destroy them.
         ;; In the end she conceived a plan.
         ;; Like a cunning fox she came to their mother and said: "My little dove, my dear friend, here is a ring for you; put it on your son's finger.
         ;; With its help he will be healthy and wealthy, but he must never take it off, and he must marry only that maiden whom the ring fits."
         ;; The old woman believed her and was overjoyed; before her death she enjoined upon her son that he take to wife a woman whom the ring would be found to fit.
         ;; Time went by and the little son grew up.
         ;; He grew up and began to seek a bride; he would like one girl, then another, but upon trying the ring he always found it to be too big or too small; it did not fit either the one or the other.
         ;; He traveled and traveled through villages and cities, tried the ring on all the lovely maidens, but could not find one whom he could take as his betrothed; he returned home and was pensive and sad.
         ;; "Little brother, why are you grieving?" his sister asked him.
         ;; He told her his trouble.
         ;; "Why is the ring so troublesome?" said the sister.
         ;; "Let me try it."
         ;; She put it on her finger and the ring clasped it, and began to gleam; it fitted her as though made to her size.
         ;; "Ah, my sister," said the brother, "you have been chosen for me by fate, you shall be my wife."
         ;; "What are you saying, my brother?
         ;; Think of God, think of the sin; one does not marry one's own sister."
         ;; But her brother did not heed her; he danced for joy and ordered that preparations be made for the wedding.
