         ;; There was once a very wealthy merchant who had a marvelously beautiful daughter.
         ;; This merchant carried goods to various provinces, and one day he came to a certain kingdom and brought precious cloths to the king as a gift.
         ;; The king said to him: "Why can I not find a bride for myself?"
         ;; The merchant answered: "I have a beautiful daughter, and she is so clever that no matter what a man is thinking, she can guess it."
         ;; The king immediately wrote a letter and called his guards.
         ;; "Go to that merchant's house," he told them, "and deliver this letter to the merchant's daughter."
         ;; The letter said: "Make ready to get married."
         ;; The merchant's daughter took the letter, burst into tears, and prepared to go, taking also her maidservant; and no one could distinguish this maid from the merchant's daughter, they were so like each other.
         ;; They dressed in dresses that were alike and went to the king for the marriage.
         ;; The maid was full of spite, and said: "Let us take a walk on the island."
         ;; They went to the island; there the maidservant gave the merchant's daughter sleeping potions, cut out her eyes, and put them in her pocket.
         ;; They answered: "We need only you, we have no use for that peasant girl."
         ;; They went to the king; he married the maid at once, and they began to live together.
         ;; The king thought to himself: "The merchant must have cheated me; she cannot be a merchant's daughter.
         ;; Why is she so ignorant?
         ;; She does not know how to do anything."
         ;; Meanwhile the merchant's daughter recovered from the illness that her maid had brought upon her.
         ;; She could not see; she could only hear and she heard an old man tending cattle.
         ;; She said to him: "Where are you, grandfather?"
         ;; "I live in a little hut."
         ;; "Please take me into your hut."
