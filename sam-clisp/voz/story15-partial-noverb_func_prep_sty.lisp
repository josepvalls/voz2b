         ;; In a certain kingdom there was a king who had three daughters of surpassing beauty.
         ;; The king guarded them more carefully than his most precious treasure; he built underground chambers and kept his daughters there like birds in a cage, so that rough winds could not blow upon them nor the red sun scorch them with his rays.
         ;; One day the princesses read in a certain book that there was a marvelous bright world, and when the king came to visit them, they straightway began to implore him with tears in their eyes, saying: "Sovereign, our father, let us out to see the bright world and walk in the green garden."
         ;; The king tried to dissuade them but to no avail.
         ;; They would not even listen to him; the more he refused, the more urgently they besought him.
         ;; There was nothing to be done, so the king granted their insistent prayer.
         ;; And so the beautiful princesses went out to walk in the garden.
         ;; They beheld the red sun, the trees, and the flowers, and were overjoyed that they had the freedom of the bright world.
         ;; They ran about in the garden and enjoyed themselves - when a sudden whirlwind seized them and carried them off far and high, no one knew whither.
         ;; The alarmed nurses and governesses ran to report this to the king; the king straightway sent his faithful servants in all directions, promising a great reward to him who should find traces of the princesses.
         ;; The servants traveled and traveled but did not discover anything and came back no wiser than they had set out.
         ;; The king called his grand council together and asked his councilors and boyars whether anyone among them would undertake to search for his daughters.
         ;; To any man who might find them, he said, he would give the princess of his choice in marriage, and a rich dowry.
         ;; The king asked once and the boyars were silent; he asked a second time and they still did not answer; he asked a third time and no one made a sound!
         ;; The king burst into tears.
         ;; "Apparently I have no friends or helpers here," he said, and ordered that a call be issued throughout the kingdom.
