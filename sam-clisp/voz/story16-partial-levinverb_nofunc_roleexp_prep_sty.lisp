         ;; You know, on the earth, there are good people and those who are a little worse.
         ;; Then there are those who don't fear God and don't even feel shame.
         ;; Wee little Havroshechka was left motherless as a small child with the latter type.
         ;; These people took her in and fed her but didn't allow her out into God's world.
         ;; Rather, they put her to work every day.
         ;; She served, cleaned and answered for all and everything.
         ;; Her step-mother had three grown daughters.
         ;; The oldest's name was One-Eye, the middle daughter's name was Two-Eye, and the youngest's name was Three-Eye.
         ;; The only thing they did was sit in the entry way and gaze outside.
         ;; Meanwhile Wee little Havroshechka did their work.
         ;; She sewed their clothes and spun and wove for them, but never heard one word of kindness.
         ;; She was only noticed when they wanted someone to abuse!
         ;; Once, Wee little Havroshechka went into the field.
         ;; Embracing her spotted cow, she lay against her neck and related how difficult her life was.
         ;; "Little mother-cow, they beat me and scold me.
         ;; They don't feed me.
         ;; And then they order me not to cry.
         ;; They gave me 200 pounds of linen to spin, weave, bleach in the sun, and roll.
         ;; It all must be done by tomorrow."
         ;; The cow replied, "Beautiful maiden, climb in one of my ears and climb out the other, and all of your work will be done."
         ;; And so it was.
         ;; As soon as the beautiful maiden climbed out of the cow's ear everything was ready - woven, washed and rolled.
         ;; She carried it to her step-mother who shut it away in a trunk with a grunt.
         ;; She then gave her even more work to do.
         ;; Havroshechka came again to the cow.
         ;; She climbed in one ear and out the other, carrying the completed things back.
         ;; The old woman was amazed.
         ;; She called One-Eye, "My wonderful daughter, my lovely daughter!
         ;; Find out who helps the orphan.
         ;; Who weaves, spins and rolls the linen?"
         ;; One-Eye went with the orphan through the forest and into the field.
         ;; She forgot her mother's instructions, became fatigued in the sun, and sprawled out in the grass.
         ;; Havroshechka coaxed, "Sleep, little eye.
         ;; Sleep, little eye!"
         ;; One-Eye's one little eye fell asleep.
         ;; While One-Eye slept, the little cow did the weaving and washing.
         ;; As the step-mother didn't learn anything from One-Eye, she sent Two-Eye.
         ;; Two-Eye also became fatigued in the sun, sprawled out in the grass, forgot her mother's instructions, and closed her eyes.
         ;; Havroshechka sang, "Sleep, little eye.
         ;; Sleep, other little eye!"
         ;; The cow did the weaving, washing, and rolling all while Two-Eye's two eyes slept.
         ;; The old woman was angry.
         ;; On the third day she sent Three-Eye and gave the orphan even more work to do.
         ;; And just like her older sisters, she bounded along and eventually fell into the grass.
         ;; Havroshechka sang, "Sleep, little eye.
         ;; Sleep, other little eye!"
         ;; But she forgot about Three-Eye's third little eye.
         ;; Two eyes fell asleep, while the third watched and saw everything: from the beautiful maiden climbing in one ear and out the other and then gathering up all the prepared linens.
         ;; Three-Eye told her mother  everything she saw.
         ;; The old woman rejoiced.
         ;; On the very next day she came to her husband, "Slaughter that spotted cow!"
         ;; The old man was reluctant.
         ;; "What are you saying, woman?
         ;; Are you out of your mind?
         ;; That cow is young and healthy!"
         ;; But she was absolutely determined.
         ;; So, he sharpened the knife.
         ;; Havroshechka ran to the cow.
         ;; "Little cow-mother!
         ;; They want to slaughter you."
         ;; "Don't eat my meat, beautiful maiden.
         ;; Gather my bones, tie them in a handkerchief, then plant them in the garden, and never forget me.
         ;; Water my bones every morning."
         ;; Havroshechka did everything as the cow instructed.
         ;; She endured great hunger, but still didn't eat any meat.
         ;; She watered the bones in the garden every day, from which an apple tree grew.
         ;; Goodness, what a tree it was!
         ;; The apples were plump.
         ;; The rustling leaves were golden.
         ;; The bowing branches were silver.
         ;; Whoever rode by stopped to look at the tree.
         ;; Whoever walked by would stare in wonder.
         ;; One day the girls were strolling in the garden when a nobleman rode through the field.
         ;; He was wealthy, handsome, and young.
         ;; Seeing the apples, he got the girls' attention.
         ;; "Maiden-beauties!"
         ;; he said, "whoever can bring me an apple will be my wife."
         ;; And so the three sisters pushed themselves in front of each other to get to the apple tree.
         ;; While before the apples hung lower than arm's height, suddenly they were oh so high, to the point that they were far above their heads.
         ;; The sisters wanted to knock them off the tree, but the leaves blinded them.
         ;; They wanted to pick the apples, but the branches unpicked their braids.
         ;; No matter how they struggled and thrashed about, tearing their hands, they still couldn't pick any apples.
         ;; Havroshechka came to the tree.
         ;; The branches bowed down and apples drooped into her reach.
         ;; The nobleman married her.
         ;; They lived in happiness, without any sorrow.
