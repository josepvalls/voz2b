         ;; For many years a certain tsar had kept under lock and key a little peasant all made of copper, with iron hands and a steel head - a cunning man, a wizard of a man!
         ;; Prince Ivan, the tsar's son who was still a little boy, walked by the prison.
         ;; The old man called him and began to beg: "Prince Ivan, please give me a drink!"
         ;; Prince Ivan did not know anything yet, he was very little, so he drew some water and gave it to him; with the help of the water the old man vanished from the prison.
