         ;; Once upon a time there lived a man and a woman who had two sons and one daughter.
         ;; One day the father sent his sons to plough.
         ;; They asked, "Who will bring us our lunch?"
         ;; The father said, "The girl."
         ;; The girl asked, "How will I find you there?"
         ;; Then the brothers answered, "After coming to the mountain you will see three paths.
         ;; You should follow the one with shavings on it."
         ;; A dragon saw the brothers marking the path with shavings; he then took those shavings and scattered them on the way to his own courtyard.
         ;; The mother cooked lunch and gave it to her daughter to carry.
         ;; The girl went out to the mountain and walked along the path with the shavings, came to the dragon's courtyard, who then caught her and threw her into a hole.
         ;; The brothers waited and waited for their lunch, finally they unharnessed their oxen, left them to graze, went home, and asked their mother: "Mom, where is our lunch?"
         ;; Mother said, "I've sent it with the girl a long time ago."
         ;; So they waited for her until the evening.
         ;; In the morning after waking up they saw that she hadn't come back!
         ;; The brothers said, "It must be that cursed dragon who caught her."
         ;; They got dressed and went to look for their sister.
         ;; They walked and walked - when suddenly they saw the herdsman tending a herd.
         ;; They greeted each other; the herdsman asked,"Where are you going?"
         ;; They replied, "To the dragon - to take our sister back."
         ;; "If you want to set your sister free - you should eat my biggest ox."
         ;; But they didn't want to and went further.
         ;; They walked and walked - when suddenly they saw the shepherd tending the sheep.
         ;; They greeted him.
         ;; He asked, "Where are you going?"
         ;; "To the dragon - to take our sister back""If you want to set your sister free - you should eat my biggest ram."
         ;; But they didn't want to and went further.

         ;; "To the dragon - to take our sister back""If you want to set your sister free - you should eat my biggest hog."
         ;; But they didn't want to and went further.
         ;; They walked and walked - when suddenly they saw the dragon standing near his house.
         ;; The dragon greeted them and asked, "Why did you come here?"
         ;; "We have come to you - to take back our sister""If you want to set your sister free - you have to eat twelve oxen, twelve rams and twelve hogs."
         ;; But they managed to eat only tiny pieces and no longer wanted anymore.
         ;; Dragon then pinned them under a stone.
         ;; Mother cried that neither her sons nor daughter came back home.
         ;; Once, she took the buckets and went to the well to fetch water.
         ;; After collecting water and as she was on her way back a rolling pea on the road hopped into a bucket, unknown to her.
         ;; After coming home she poured the water - then she looked inside: there was a pea in one of the buckets, she took and ate it, and a son was born from that pea.
         ;; He was given the name, Rolling Pea; he grew not by the hour, but by the minute.
         ;; Once during supper Rolling Pea asked, "Did you have any other children, mom?"
         ;; "I had two sons and one daughter."
         ;; "And where are they?"
         ;; "The dragon stole my daughter, then my sons went to look for her, but neither my sons nor my daughter ever came back."
         ;; He finished eating, put his shoes on and got dressed.
         ;; "I will go and find them."
         ;; Then Rolling Pea went to the smith and asked him to make a large mace.
         ;; The smith made him a large mace; Rolling Pea took that mace, paid and then went on his way.
         ;; He walked and walked - when suddenly he saw the herdsman tending the herd.
         ;; He greeted him and then the herdsman asked, "Where are you going?"
         ;; "To the dragon - to take my sister back""Eat my biggest ox and then you can set your sister free."

         ;; He walked and walked until he saw dragon's home and his sister collecting water from the well.
         ;; "Hello, sister," said Rolling Pea.
         ;; She said to him, "Surely you are not my brother?"
         ;; He said, "You will see that I am!"
         ;; The dragon came out, "Ah, hello!"
         ;; he said.
         ;; "Hello!"
         ;; The dragon asked him, "Why did you come here?"
         ;; "I came for my sister and brothers."
         ;; "Eat twelve oxen, twelve rams and twelve hogs."
         ;; He ate them all.
         ;; The dragon said, "Well done!"
         ;; "Now, do you want to fight me or to make peace with me?"
         ;; "I want to fight you!
         ;; I don't want to make peace with you."
         ;; "Blow the horn," said dragon.
         ;; "You blow first," said Rolling Pea.
         ;; "You are the master of the house in this case, not me."
         ;; The dragon blew the horn and it turned into cast iron; Rolling Pea blew the horn and it turned into copper.
         ;; Rolling Pea hit the dragon with his mace, so that he sank ankle-deep in the ground, Rolling Pea struck him the second time and killed the dragon.
         ;; Then he cut the dragon into small pieces, scattered his ashes, set his brothers free from under the stone, took his sister, and they all went back home.
         ;; His father and his mother were again happy!
