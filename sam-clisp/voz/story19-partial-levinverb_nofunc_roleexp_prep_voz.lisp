         ;; In a certain kingdom, in a certain land, there lived a widowed priest and his daughter.
         ;; He took very good care of the girl, and whenever he went to see someone in his parish he always brought her presents; his parishioners knew that our priest had a daughter and that she expected presents.
         ;; One day he went to a village of his parish about twelve versts away, to give someone communion, and was received very hospitably.
         ;; He forgot to ask for a present for his daughter, and set out for home.
         ;; As he was riding on the road, he beheld a human head burning - in fact, it was almost all burned, only ashes remained.
         ;; At first he passed it by, but then he changed his mind.
         ;; "Here is a human head burning," he thought.
         ;; "I will take it, put the ashes in my pocket, bring them home, and place them in the cellar."
         ;; He picked up the ashes, mounted his horse again, and rode home.
         ;; His daughter came out to meet him in the yard and helped him down from his horse; he had a headache, probably from the wind, and she put him to sleep in the featherbed.
         ;; But then she thought: "My father must have brought me a present."
         ;; She looked into his pocket; meanwhile the ashes he had picked up had turned into a box.
         ;; She took out this box and said: "Oh, this is a fine box; what shall I do with it?"
         ;; She touched it with her tongue and became pregnant.
         ;; What other women bear after long weeks, she bore in hours; her time for delivery came, and she gave birth to a boy.
         ;; He was christened at once and named Nodey, the priest's grandson.
         ;; The boy began to grow; what other boys achieve in years, he achieved in hours; at six weeks he went out into the street to play ball with the other boys.
         ;; When he hit a ball, it flew, one heard it buzz through the air, but one did not see it.
         ;; If he struck someone in the leg, the leg came off; if he struck someone in the arm, the arm came off; and when he struck someone in the head, the poor fellow's head came off.
         ;; The fathers of these children came to the priest and said to him: "Father, please do not allow your grandson to go into the street to play with the other children; he has done a great deal of damage."
         ;; One would complain that his boy had lost his head, another that his child had lost an arm.
         ;; "Please, Father," they said, "keep him in the house."
         ;; So the priest kept Nodey at home until summer came; by then he had grown quite big, and said: "Dear grandfather, what work shall we do now?"
         ;; The priest was overjoyed and said to his daughter: "My beloved daughter, God be thanked for having given us an heir; he is a godsend, he is so strong.
         ;; Now what shall we undertake?
         ;; Let us work."
         ;; And he said to his grandson: "Come, grandson, let us clear some marshy ground."
         ;; "Let us go, grandfather."
         ;; So they went to the marshes and chose a place; the grandfather began to cut a pine tree, and Nodey said: "Grandfather, don't you work, but give me your blessing."
         ;; "Well," said the grandfather, "may God bless you."
         ;; And the boy set to work with such vigor that the woods began to tremble; he gave one blow with his ax, and the tree flew down.
         ;; Before noon he had cleared about four acres of marshy ground.
         ;; The grandfather said: "Now we have to chop the wood and burn it."
         ;; He answered: "Grandfather, let us simply pile it up."
         ;; After three days the former wilderness had become farm land.
         ;; With the help of his grandfather Nodey sowed oats, and the oats throve beautifully, as never before.
         ;; Now a bear began to haunt that field of oats.
         ;; The priest went to inspect the new field and found that much of the grain had been eaten.
         ;; He returned home, and his grandson asked him: "Well, grandfather, how is our field?"
         ;; "Very fine, little grandson, only some wild horse has begun to frequent it - he has an enormous appetite and has done much damage."
         ;; "Do you mean to say, grandfather, that after all the work I did, a good-for-nothing like that has done so much damage?
         ;; I'll go catch him.
         ;; Find me some hemp, as much as you can."
         ;; He sat down, wove a hempen bridle, and having eaten his dinner, went to the woods.
         ;; When he saw the field, he was amazed at the sight.
         ;; "My God," he said, "what mischief this horse has done!
         ;; It's frightful!"
         ;; And he sat down on a tree stump in the field.
         ;; As he sat thus, the bear came out of the woods, went straight into the oat field, and began to trample the plants.
         ;; Our brave youth was surprised.
         ;; "What a strange creature!"
         ;; he said.
         ;; "I never saw such a horse.
         ;; And how he spoils the oats!"
         ;; Meanwhile the bear came close to him; he was not frightened by the man on the tree stump, but took him to be part of it.
         ;; When he came quite close, Nodey jumped down and - one, two, three - caught the bear by the ears, hugged him tight, and pressed him to the ground.
         ;; The bear thought to himself: "What's this?"
         ;; He tried to get up; but Nodey would not let him; he put the hempen bridle on him, and led him home.
         ;; And while he was leading him, whenever the bear caught on a tree, the tree was uprooted.
         ;; Well, Nodey brought him home, tied him to a pillar in the middle of the yard, and went into the house.
         ;; "Lord, what a horse that was, grandfather!
         ;; How tired I am from dragging him home!"
         ;; The priest looked out into the yard and gasped.
         ;; "Look, my daughter," he said, "what your little son, my grandson, has done!"
         ;; And for a long time they gazed in admiration.
         ;; Nodey said: "Don't stare, but tell me what we will do with this horse, what work we will give it, for it is very strong."
         ;; "Use it to bring wood," said the grandfather.
         ;; So Nodey took the bear, harnessed him to a cart, and began to use him to carry wood.
         ;; In three days he had carted off the whole village.
         ;; The villagers did not venture to go out, for the entire village had disappeared.
         ;; They came to the priest and said to him: "Put him wherever you will, but he must not stay here; what kind of behavior is this?
         ;; In three days he has taken the whole village away.
         ;; We cannot go out for fear of him."
         ;; "Ah, my daughter," said the priest, "what are we to do?
         ;; I am sorry for your son, my grandson, but we must send him away; let him go wherever you will."
         ;; And he called his grandson to him and said: "Well, my beloved grandson, the villagers have come with a request that we send you away; I am sorry for you, but you must go."
         ;; "Eh, my beloved grandfather, you should have told me that long ago, and I would have gone without delay.
         ;; My beloved mother, bake a loaf of bread for me."
         ;; His mother baked a loaf of bread for him and put it in his knapsack.
         ;; He rose very early and washed himself clean.
         ;; Then he put his knapsack on his back and asked for a blessing: "My beloved mother and my dear grandfather, give me your blessing for my journey."
         ;; He said his prayers and set out; he came to the open field, and instead of taking a road or a path, went through thick forests and deep swamps and walked for seven days, with his mouth open and his tongue hanging out.
         ;; And he came to the thrice ninth land, to the thrice tenth kingdom, and found himself in an open field, near a steep mountain, and saw there Gorynya, the mighty hero, who kicked mountains about like balls.
         ;; Nodey, the priest's grandson, went to him and said: "God be with you, Gorynya, mighty hero!
         ;; What immense strength is in you, that you can kick mountains about like balls!"
         ;; Gorynya answered him: "Eh, brave youth, do not admire my strength!
         ;; It is said that beyond thrice nine lands, in the thrice tenth kingdom, there is a certain Nodey, a priest's grandson, who is much stronger than I. He brought a bear from the woods and on this bear loaded his entire village.
         ;; His bones will not be carried by a raven, he will not be borne by a good young steed!"
         ;; And Nodey answered him: "Ah, brother Gorynya, mighty hero!
         ;; The raven did not carry his bones, but he himself is here."
         ;; Gorynya said: "Ah, brother, so you are Nodey, the priest's grandson!
         ;; Take me with you as your younger brother!"
         ;; Nodey took him, and they traveled to many far lands and conquered many mighty knights and captured many cities; then they both got married, and they and their brides prospered.
