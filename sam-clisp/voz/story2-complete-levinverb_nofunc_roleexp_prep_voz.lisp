         ;; An old man lived with his old wife; they had a daughter and a little son.
         ;; "Daughter, daughter," said the mother, "we are going to work; we shall bring you back a bun, sew you a dress, and buy you a kerchief.
         ;; Be careful, watch over your little brother, do not leave the house."
         ;; The parents went away and the daughter forgot what they had told her; she put her brother on the grass beneath the window, ran out into the street, and became absorbed in games.
         ;; The girl came back and found her brother gone.
         ;; She gasped, and rushed to look in every corner, but could not find him.
         ;; She called him, wept, and lamented that her father and mother would scold her severely; still her little brother did not answer.
         ;; She ran into the open field; the swan geese flashed in the distance and vanished behind a dark forest.
         ;; The swan geese had long had a bad reputation; they had done a great deal of damage and stolen many little children.
