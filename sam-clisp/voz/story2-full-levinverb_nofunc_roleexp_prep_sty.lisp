         ;; An old man lived with his old wife; they had a daughter and a little son.
         ;; "Daughter, daughter," said the mother, "we are going to work; we shall bring you back a bun, sew you a dress, and buy you a kerchief.
         ;; Be careful, watch over your little brother, do not leave the house."
         ;; The parents went away and the daughter forgot what they had told her; she put her brother on the grass beneath the window, ran out into the street, and became absorbed in games.
         ;; The girl came back and found her brother gone.
         ;; She gasped, and rushed to look in every corner, but could not find him.
         ;; She called him, wept, and lamented that her father and mother would scold her severely; still her little brother did not answer.
         ;; She ran into the open field; the swan geese flashed in the distance and vanished behind a dark forest.
         ;; The swan geese had long had a bad reputation; they had done a great deal of damage and stolen many little children.
         ;; "Stove, stove, tell me, whither have the geese flown?"
         ;; "If you eat my cake of rye I will tell you."
         ;; "Oh, in my father's house we don't even eat cakes of wheat!"
         ;; The stove did not tell her.
         ;; She ran farther and saw an apple tree.
         ;; "Apple tree, apple tree, tell me, whither have the geese flown?"
         ;; "If you eat one of my wild apples, I will tell you."
         ;; "Oh, in my father's house we don't even eat sweet apples."
         ;; She ran farther and saw a river of milk with shores of pudding.
         ;; "River of milk, shores of pudding, whither have the geese flown ?"
         ;; "If you eat of my simple pudding with milk, I will tell you."
         ;; "Oh, in my father's house we don't even eat cream."
         ;; She would have run in the fields and wandered in the woods for a long time, if she had not luckily met a hedgehog.
         ;; She wanted to nudge him, but was afraid that he would prick her, and she asked: "Hedgehog, hedgehog, have you not seen whither the geese have flown?"
         ;; "Thither," he said, and showed her.
         ;; She ran and saw a little hut that stood on chicken legs and turned round and round.
         ;; In the little hut lay Baba Yaga with veined snout and clay legs, and the little brother was sitting on a bench, playing with golden apples.
         ;; His sister saw him, crept near him, seized him, and carried him away.
         ;; But the geese flew after her: if the robbers overtook her, where would she hide?
         ;; There flowed the river of milk with shores of pudding.
         ;; "Little mother river, hide me!" she begged.
         ;; "If you eat my pudding."
         ;; There was nothing to be done; she ate it, and the river hid her beneath the shore, and the geese flew by.
         ;; She went out, said "Thank you," and ran on, carrying her brother; and the geese turned back and flew toward her.
         ;; What could she do in this trouble?
         ;; There was the apple tree.
         ;; "Apple tree, apple tree, little mother, hide me !" she begged.
         ;; "If you eat my wild apple."
         ;; She ate it quickly.
         ;; The apple tree covered her with branches and leaves; the geese flew by.
         ;; She went out again and ran on with her brother.
         ;; The geese saw her and flew after her.
         ;; They came quite close, they began to strike her with their wings; at any moment they would tear her brother from her hands.
         ;; Luckily there was the stove on her path.
         ;; "Madam Stove, hide me!" she begged.
         ;; "If you eat my cake of rye."
         ;; The girl quickly stuck the cake in her mouth, went into the stove, and sat there.
         ;; The geese whirred and whirred, quacked and quacked, and finally flew away without recovering their prey.
         ;; And the girl ran home, and it was a good thing that she came when she did, for soon afterward her mother and father arrived.
