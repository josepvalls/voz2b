         ;; There was a soldier sent to distant lands.
         ;; He served his term, received an honorable discharge and set off to his homeland.
         ;; He walked through many lands and through several kingdoms.
         ;; Eventually he came to one capital where he stopped at the apartment of a poor, old woman.
         ;; He asked her, "How is everything, grandmother, in this kingdom?
         ;; Is everything going well?"
         ;; "If only, soldier!
         ;; Our king has a beautiful daughter, Princess Martha.
         ;; A foreign prince tried to woo her in marriage, but the princess didn't want to marry him.
         ;; So he set an evil spirit on her.
         ;; She's already been ill for three years!
         ;; The evil spirit doesn't give her any peace at night.
         ;; Her heart beats quickly and she screams out of control, and although the king has consulted wizards and wise-men - nobody can heal her!"
         ;; The soldier listened to her story and thought to himself, "I shall go and try my fortune.
         ;; Maybe I'll be able to save the princess!
         ;; The king will at least give me something for the road."
         ;; He grabbed his overcoat, cleaned the buttons with chalk, put it on and marched to the palace.
         ;; A lady-in-waiting saw him.
         ;; She guessed as to why he came, so she grabbed his arm and led him straight to the king.
         ;; "Hello, soldier!
         ;; What good news do you have?"
         ;; said the king.
         ;; "I wish you good health, your royal majesty!
         ;; I heard that your daughter, Princess Martha, is ill.
         ;; I can heal her."
         ;; "Good, brother!
         ;; If you heal her I will cover you with gold from head to toe."
         ;; "Your majesty, command that everything I ask for is given to me."
         ;; "Speak.
         ;; What do you need?"
         ;; "Give me a measure of cast-iron bullets, a measure of walnuts, a pound of candles, and two decks of cards.
         ;; Also make me an iron rod, an iron rake with five prongs and a spring-loaded iron man."
         ;; "Well, okay.
         ;; Everything will be ready by tomorrow."
         ;; They prepared everything as necessary.
         ;; The soldier locked all the windows and doors in the palace and made the sign of the orthodox cross over them.
         ;; He left only one door unlocked.
         ;; He stood watch near that door.
         ;; He illuminated the room with candles and placed the cards on the table while he poured the iron bullets and walnuts into his pockets.
         ;; After he finished making everything ready, he waited.
         ;; Suddenly, right at midnight, up flew the evil spirit.
         ;; But he couldn't get in!
         ;; He flew all around the palace and only then found the open door.
         ;; He turned into a man and entered.
         ;; "Who goes there?"
         ;; yelled the soldier.
         ;; "Let me through, soldier!
         ;; I'm a chamber servant."
         ;; "Where have you, infidel, been roaming up until now?"
         ;; "Where I was doesn't exist anymore!
         ;; Would you give me some nuts to chew on?"
         ;; "There are so many of you infidels about!
         ;; If I give everyone of you a nut, then I'll have none left for myself."
         ;; "Please give me some!"
         ;; "Well, here you go!"
         ;; and gave him a bullet.
         ;; The devil put the bullet into his mouth, chewed and chewed and crunched it down to a little patty.
         ;; The devil tried to swallow it but couldn't.
         ;; While he was belaboring with the iron bullet, the soldier chewed and ate over twenty nuts.
         ;; "Hey, soldier," said the devil, "you have strong teeth!"
         ;; "I can see that you're a fool," answered the soldier.
         ;; "I have served the king twenty-five years and ground my teeth down on the hardtack.
         ;; You should have seen what kind of chap I was in my younger years!"
         ;; "Let's play cards, soldier."
         ;; "And what should we play for?"
         ;; "For money, of course."
         ;; "Oh you, fiend!
         ;; Well, what kind of money does a soldier have?
         ;; All he has is a stipend.
         ;; He receives just three coins for a whole day.
         ;; He needs to buy soap, shoe polish, chalk, and glue.
         ;; And he needs to go to the bathhouse.
         ;; How about the loser gets punched by the winner?"
         ;; "Sure!"
         ;; So they started to play for punches.
         ;; The devil lost three times to the soldier.
         ;; "Let's begin," said the soldier.
         ;; "I'll punch you now!"
         ;; "Wait until you have ten, then you can use your punches.
         ;; There's no point in sullying your hand over three punches."
         ;; "Fine!"
         ;; They continued to play.
         ;; The soldier was dealt three cards of one suit - bringing his tally of owed punches to ten.
         ;; "Well, now," he said to the devil, "show me your forehead.
         ;; I'm going to show you what it's like to play for punches with your brother!
         ;; I'll cut you down soldier-style!
         ;; You'll rue the day!"
         ;; The devil implored the soldier, asking him to only beat him softly.
         ;; "Now, now, with you infidels, give you an inch and you'll walk all over us.
         ;; As soon as you have to pay up you don't want to play.
         ;; I cannot possibly be merciful.
         ;; I am a soldier, and I made an oath to always act honorably."
         ;; "Soldier, take money!"
         ;; "And what would I do with money?
         ;; I played for punches and so pay with punches.
         ;; But, perhaps we could do this - I have a younger brother.
         ;; Let's go to him.
         ;; He'll hit you much softer than I. But, if you don't want to, then I'll hit you myself!"
         ;; "No, soldier, it's better to take me to your younger brother."
         ;; The soldier led the evil one to the iron man.
         ;; He triggered the spring and whacked the devil in the forehead.
         ;; He was knocked to the other side of the room.
         ;; Then the soldier grabbed him by the arm, "Wait here!
         ;; I still owe you nine more punches."
         ;; He set the spring flying again and knocked the devil so hard that he rolled head-over-heels almost breaking through the wall!
         ;; The third time it knocked the evil one straight into the window.
         ;; He smashed out the frame, jumped out and took to his heels.
         ;; "Remember, cursed," yelled the soldier, "you still have seven punches coming to you!"
         ;; But the devil fled, leaving only his tracks behind him.
         ;; In the morning the king asked Princess Martha, "Well, how was your rest last night?"
         ;; "Peaceful, father!"
         ;; The next night, Satan sent a different devil to the palace.
         ;; They came to scare and torment the princess by turn.
         ;; For this one the soldier still had nuts leftover!
         ;; Over the course of thirteen nights, thirteen devils got into a scrape with the soldier.
         ;; They all had an equally rough time.
         ;; Not one wanted to come again.
         ;; "Well, grandchildren," said Satan, "I, myself, will go now."
         ;; Satan came to the palace to chat with the soldier about one thing or another.
         ;; They started playing cards.
         ;; The soldier beat him and led him to his younger brother to oblige him with wallops.
         ;; When they got there, the soldier set the springs, and the younger brother grasped Satan with his iron arms so tightly that Satan couldn't budge backward or forward.
         ;; The soldier grabbed the iron bar and started to beat Satan.
         ;; As he struck Satan he said, "Here's for the cards!
         ;; Here's for tormenting Princess Martha!"
         ;; He wore out the iron rod so he grabbed the rake.
         ;; Satan bellowed at the top of his lungs while the soldier raked him over according to his will.
         ;; He did the job so thoroughly that when Satan finally broke free he fled in terror without even looking back.
         ;; Satan returned to his swamp and groaned, "Augh, grandchildren, that soldier almost beat me to death!"
         ;; "Now, grandfather, you see how horrible he is!
         ;; It's already been two weeks since I was in the palace and my head is still splitting!
         ;; I'm just glad it was his younger brother who beat me and not the soldier!"
         ;; So, the devils made a plan to drive that soldier out of the palace.
         ;; After they thought and thought, they decided to buy him off with gold.
         ;; They all ran together to make him the offer.
         ;; Noticing their fear, the soldier yelled in a loud voice, "Hey, brother, come here quickly!
         ;; Our debtors came back.
         ;; It's time for them to receive their punches."
         ;; "That's enough!
         ;; That's enough, soldier!
         ;; We came to negotiate with you.
         ;; Take as much gold from us as you want, only leave the palace!"
         ;; "No!
         ;; What is gold to me?
         ;; If you want to pay your debt, then you all must climb into this knapsack.
         ;; I've heard that evil spirits are excruciatingly tricky.
         ;; Even if they are in a tiny crevice, they can still get out!
         ;; Seriously, if you do this, on my word, I'll leave the palace!"
         ;; The devils rejoiced.
         ;; "Well, soldier, open up your knapsack."
         ;; The soldier opened it, and they all climbed right in with Satan lying on top.
         ;; "Pack in tighter," said the soldier, "so that I can close all the buckles."
         ;; "Buckle?
         ;; You don't need to do that!"
         ;; "You'll be happy if I can completely fasten it!
         ;; If not, then - don't get upset - I won't leave the palace for anything!"
         ;; And so the soldier fastened every buckle on the knapsack, he crossed himself, put the knapsack on his back and went to the king.
         ;; "Your royal majesty!
         ;; Order thirty iron hammers to be made.
         ;; Each hammer must weigh 100 pounds apiece."
         ;; The king gave the command.
         ;; Thirty hammers were made immediately.
         ;; The soldier brought the knapsack to the smithy, laid it on the anvil and ordered it to be pounded as hard as possible.
         ;; It became awful for the devils.
         ;; It was impossible for them to crawl out!
         ;; The soldier certainly fooled them!
         ;; "That's enough!"
         ;; He threw the knapsack onto his shoulders and appeared before the king to report, "My service here is done.
         ;; No evil spirits will further disturb the princess."
         ;; The king thanked him, "Excellent job, soldier!
         ;; Wander through all the inns and taverns, demand anything your heart desires.
         ;; You can have anything you want!"
         ;; The king assigned a scribe to follow the soldier to keep track of the state's bill.
         ;; And so, he wandered and wandered.
         ;; He wandered for a whole month and then returned to the king.
         ;; "Well, soldier, did you have your fill?"
         ;; "I had my fill, your majesty!
         ;; I want to go home."
         ;; "What are you saying?
         ;; Stay with us.
         ;; I'll make you my right-hand man."
         ;; "No, sovereign, I would like to see my family."
         ;; "Well, go with God!"
         ;; said the king.
         ;; He gave him a carriage, horses and more than enough money for a whole lifetime.
         ;; The soldier left for his homeland.
         ;; He came along a road to a certain village and saw a familiar soldier - they had served in the same regiment.
         ;; "Hello, brother!"
         ;; "Hello!"
         ;; "How do you fare?
         ;; What's new?"
         ;; "Everything is the same."
         ;; "Well, the Lord has given me great happiness.
         ;; I've suddenly become very rich!
         ;; We should toast to this joy.
         ;; Run, brother, and buy a cooler of wine."
         ;; "I'd be happy to fetch one, but, as you see, my livestock is still not gathered.
         ;; You'll have to go to the trouble and get it yourself.
         ;; The tavern is right there, not too far!"
         ;; "Fine.
         ;; You, take my knapsack.
         ;; Set it in the hut and warn the women to not touch it!"
         ;; Our soldier went off to get wine while his countryman brought the knapsack into the hut and warned the women, "Don't touch it!"
         ;; While he gathered his livestock the women couldn't be patient, "Let's take a look.
         ;; What is stuffed into this knapsack?"
         ;; They unfastened it.
         ;; Out skipped the devils with a clamor and a crash.
         ;; They knocked the doors from the hinges and ran!
         ;; Along the road they met the soldier with the wine.
         ;; "Augh, you cursed ones!
         ;; Who let you out?"
         ;; The devils were so scared when they saw him, they threw themselves into the cavity below the mill and there they stayed forever.
         ;; The soldier returned to the hut, thoroughly scolded the women and then went on a walk with his old comrade.
         ;; Later, he arrived home and began to live a wealthy and happy life.
