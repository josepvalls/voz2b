         ;; In a certain kingdom in a certain land there lived one Bukhtan Bukhtanovich, who had a stove built on pillars in the middle of a field.
         ;; He lay on the stove in cockroach milk up to his elbows.
         ;; A fox came to him and said: "Bukhtan Bukhtanovich, would you like me to marry you to the tsar's daughter?"
         ;; "What's that you're saying, little fox?"
         ;; "Do you have any money?"
         ;; "I have one five kopek piece."
         ;; "Hand it over!"
         ;; The fox took the coin, exchanged it for smaller coins - kopeks, pennies, and halfpennies, went to the tsar, and said: "Tsar, give me a quart measure to measure Bukhtan Bukhtanovich's money."
         ;; The tsar said: "Take one!"
         ;; The fox took it home, stuck one kopek behind the hoop around the measure, brought it back to the tsar, and said: "Tsar, a quart measure is not big enough; give me a peck measure to measure Bukhtan Bukhtanovich's money."
         ;; "Take one!"
         ;; The fox took it home, stuck a kopek behind the hoop of the measure, and brought it back to the tsar.
         ;; "Tsar, a peck measure is not big enough; give me a bushel measure."
         ;; "Take one!"
         ;; The Fox took it home, stuck what remained of his coins behind the hoop, and brought it back to the tsar.
         ;; He said: "Have you measured all his money, little fox?"
         ;; The fox answered: "All of it.
         ;; Now, tsar, I have come for a good purpose: give your daughter in marriage to Bukhtan Bukhtanovich."
         ;; "Very well; show me the suitor."
         ;; The fox ran home.
         ;; "Bukhtan Bukhtanovich, have you any clothes?
         ;; Put them on."
         ;; He dressed and, accompanied by the fox, went to the tsar.
         ;; The fox gave Bukhtan a push and he fell into the mud.
         ;; The fox ran to him.
         ;; "What is the matter with you, Bukhtan Bukhtanovich?"
         ;; Saying this, the fox smeared him with mud all over.
         ;; "Wait here, Bukhtan Bukhtanovich, I shall run to the tsar."
         ;; The fox came to the tsar and said: "Tsar, I was walking with Bukhtan Bukhtanovich on a board over a ditch - it was a wretched little board; we were not careful enough and somehow fell into the mud.
         ;; Bukhtan Bukhtanovich is all dirty and unfit to come to town; have you some clothes you could lend him?"
         ;; "Here, take these."
         ;; The fox took the clothes and came to Bukhtan Bukhtanovich.
         ;; "Here, change your clothes, Bukhtan, and let us go."
