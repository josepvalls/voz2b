         ;; In a certain kingdom in a certain land there lived one Bukhtan Bukhtanovich, who had a stove built on pillars in the middle of a field.
         ;; He lay on the stove in cockroach milk up to his elbows.
         ;; "What's that you're saying, little fox?"
         ;; "Do you have any money?"
         ;; "I have one five kopek piece."
         ;; "Hand it over!"
         ;; The fox took the coin, exchanged it for smaller coins - kopeks, pennies, and halfpennies, went to the tsar, and said: "Tsar, give me a quart measure to measure Bukhtan Bukhtanovich's money."
         ;; The tsar said: "Take one!"
         ;; The fox took it home, stuck one kopek behind the hoop around the measure, brought it back to the tsar, and said: "Tsar, a quart measure is not big enough; give me a peck measure to measure Bukhtan Bukhtanovich's money."
         ;; "Take one!"
         ;; The fox took it home, stuck a kopek behind the hoop of the measure, and brought it back to the tsar.
         ;; "Tsar, a peck measure is not big enough; give me a bushel measure."
         ;; "Take one!"
         ;; The Fox took it home, stuck what remained of his coins behind the hoop, and brought it back to the tsar.
         ;; He said: "Have you measured all his money, little fox?"
         ;; The fox answered: "All of it.
         ;; Now, tsar, I have come for a good purpose: give your daughter in marriage to Bukhtan Bukhtanovich."
         ;; "Very well; show me the suitor."
         ;; The fox ran home.
         ;; "Bukhtan Bukhtanovich, have you any clothes?
         ;; Put them on."
         ;; He dressed and, accompanied by the fox, went to the tsar.
         ;; They walked along the market place and had to cross on a board over a muddy ditch.
         ;; The fox gave Bukhtan a push and he fell into the mud.
         ;; The fox ran to him.
         ;; "What is the matter with you, Bukhtan Bukhtanovich?"
         ;; Saying this, the fox smeared him with mud all over.
         ;; "Wait here, Bukhtan Bukhtanovich, I shall run to the tsar."
         ;; The fox came to the tsar and said: "Tsar, I was walking with Bukhtan Bukhtanovich on a board over a ditch - it was a wretched little board; we were not careful enough and somehow fell into the mud.
         ;; Bukhtan Bukhtanovich is all dirty and unfit to come to town; have you some clothes you could lend him?"
         ;; "Here, take these."
         ;; The fox took the clothes and came to Bukhtan Bukhtanovich.
         ;; "Here, change your clothes, Bukhtan, and let us go."
         ;; They came to the tsar, and at the tsar's palace the table was already set.
         ;; Bukhtan did not look at anything except himself: he had never seen such clothes in his life.
         ;; The tsar winked to the fox: "Little fox, why does this Bukhtan Bukhtanovich look only at himself?"
         ;; "Tsar, I think he is ashamed to be wearing such clothes; never in his life has he worn such mean garments.
         ;; Tsar, give him the garment that you yourself wear on Easter Sunday."
         ;; And to Bukhtan the fox whispered: "Don't look at yourself!"
         ;; Bukhtan Bukhtanovich stared at a chair - it was a gilded one.
         ;; The tsar again whispered to the fox: "Little fox, why does Bukhtan Bukhtanovich look only at that chair?"
         ;; "Tsar, in his house such chairs stand only in the bathhouse."
         ;; The tsar flung the chair out of the room.
         ;; The fox whispered to Bukhtan: "Do not look at one thing; look here a bit and there a bit."
         ;; They began to talk about the purpose of their visit, the match.
         ;; And then they celebrated the wedding -does a wedding take long in a tsar's palace?
         ;; Three ships were loaded for Bukhtan Bukhtanovich and they traveled homeward.
         ;; Bukhtan Bukhtanovich and his wife were on one of the ships, and the fox ran along the shore.
         ;; Bukhtan saw his stove and cried: "Little fox, little fox, there is my stove."
         ;; "Be quiet, Bukhtan Bukhtanovich, that stove is a disgrace."
         ;; Bukhtan Bukhtanovich sailed on, and the fox ran ahead of him on the shore.
         ;; He came to a hill and climbed it.
         ;; On the hill stood a huge stone house, and around it was an enormous kingdom.
         ;; The fox went into the house and at first saw no one; then he ran into a chamber, and there in the best bed lay Dragon, Son of the Dragon, stretching himself.
         ;; Raven, Son of the Raven, was perched on the chimney, and Cat, Son of the Cat, sat on a throne.
         ;; The fox said: "Why are you sitting here?
         ;; The tsar is coming with fire and the tsarina with lightning, they will scorch and burn you."
         ;; "Little fox, whither shall we go?"
         ;; "Cat, Son of the Cat, go into the barrel."
         ;; And the fox sealed him up in the barrel.
         ;; "Raven, Son of the Raven, go into the mortar!"
         ;; And the fox sealed him up in the mortar; then he wrapped Dragon, Son of the Dragon, in straw and took him out into the street.
         ;; The ships arrived.
         ;; The fox ordered all the beasts to be thrown into the water; the Cossacks threw them in at once.
         ;; Bukhtan Bukhtanovich moved all his possessions into that house; there he lived happily and prospered, ruled and governed, and there he ended his life.
