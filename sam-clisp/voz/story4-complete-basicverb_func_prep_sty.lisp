         ;; In a certain kingdom in a certain land there lived a king who had three sons.
         ;; One day they said to him: "Father, our gracious sovereign, give us your blessing; we wish to go hunting."
         ;; The father gave them his blessing and they set out in different directions.
         ;; The youngest son rode and rode and lost his way; he came to a clearing, and there lay a dead horse, around which were gathered beasts of many kinds, birds, and reptiles.
         ;; A falcon rose, flew up to the prince, perched on his shoulder, and said: "Prince Ivan, divide that horse among us; it has lain here for thirty years, and we have been quarreling ever since, unable to find a way of sharing it."
         ;; "Thank you, Prince Ivan," said the falcon.
         ;; "For your kindness you shall be able to turn into a bright falcon or an ant whenever you wish."
         ;; Prince Ivan struck the damp earth, turned into a bright falcon, soared up into the air, and flew to the thrice tenth kingdom.
         ;; More than half of that kingdom had been swallowed into a crystal mountain.
         ;; The prince flew straight into the royal palace, turned into a goodly youth, and asked the palace guards: "Will your king take me into his service?"
         ;; "Why should he not take such a goodly youth?" they answered.
         ;; Thus he entered the service of that king and lived in his palace for one week, then a second, then a third.
         ;; The king's daughter asked her father: "Father, my sovereign, give me leave to take a ride with Prince Ivan to the crystal mountain."
         ;; The king gave her leave.
         ;; They mounted good steeds and set out.
         ;; When they approached the crystal mountain, a golden goat jumped suddenly out from nowhere.
         ;; The prince chased it; he galloped and galloped, but could not catch the goat, and when he returned the princess had vanished.
         ;; What was he to do?
         ;; How could he dare to appear before the king?
         ;; He disguised himself as a very old man, so that he would be unrecognizable, came to the palace, and said to the king: "Your Majesty, hire me as your herdsman."
         ;; "Very well," said the king, "be my herdsman.
         ;; When the three-headed dragon comes to your herd, give him three cows; when the six-headed dragon comes, give him six cows; and when the twelve-headed dragon comes, count off twelve cows."
         ;; Prince Ivan drove his herd over mountains and valleys.
         ;; Suddenly the three-headed dragon came flying from a lake and said: "Ah, Prince Ivan, what kind of work are you engaged in?
         ;; A goodly youth like you should be vying in combat, not tending cattle.
         ;; Well, let me have three cows!"
         ;; "Won't that be too much?" asked the prince.
         ;; "I myself eat only one duck a day, and you want three cows.
         ;; But you won't get any!"
         ;; The dragon flew into a rage, and instead of three cows, seized six.
         ;; Prince Ivan straightway turned into a bright falcon, cut off all the three heads of the dragon, and drove the cattle home.
         ;; "Well, grandfather," asked the king, "has the three-headed dragon come?
         ;; Did you give him three cows?"
         ;; "No, Your Majesty," replied Prince Ivan, "I did not give him any."
         ;; Next day the prince drove his herd over mountains and valleys, and the six-headed dragon came from the lake and demanded six cows.
         ;; "Ah, you gluttonous monster," said the prince, "I myself eat only one duck a day, and see what you demand!
         ;; I won't give you any!"
         ;; The dragon flew into a rage and instead of six, seized twelve cows; but the prince turned into a bright falcon, fell upon the dragon, and cut off his six heads.
         ;; He drove the herd home and the king asked him: "Well, grandfather, has the six-headed dragon come?
         ;; Has my herd grown much smaller?"
         ;; "Come he did, but he took nothing," answered the prince.
         ;; Late at night Prince Ivan turned into an ant and crawled into the crystal mountain through a little crack.
         ;; Lo and behold, the princess was in the crystal mountain.
         ;; "Good evening!" said Prince Ivan.
         ;; "How did you get here?"
         ;; "The twelve-headed dragon carried me off," said the princess.
         ;; "He lives in father's lake and has a coffer in his side.
         ;; In this coffer is a hare, in this hare is a duck, in this duck is an egg, and in this egg is a seed.
         ;; If you slay the dragon and get that seed, it will be possible to destroy the crystal mountain and rescue me."
         ;; Prince Ivan crawled out of the mountain, turned again into a herdsman, and drove his herd.
         ;; Suddenly the twelve-headed dragon flew up to him and said: "Ah, Prince Ivan, you are not doing what you should; a goodly youth like you should be vying in combat, not tending a herd.
         ;; Well, count off twelve cows for me!"
         ;; "That will be too much for you!" said the prince.
         ;; "I myself eat only one duck a day, and see what you demand!"
         ;; They began to fight, and after a long struggle or a short struggle, Prince Ivan defeated the twelve-headed dragon, slashed open his trunk, and found the coffer in his right side.
         ;; In the coffer he found a hare, in the hare a duck, in the duck an egg, in the egg a seed.
         ;; He took the seed, set it alight, and brought it to the crystal mountain, which soon melted away.
         ;; The wedding was held at once.
         ;; I was at that wedding too.
         ;; I drank beer and mead; they flowed down my beard but did not go into my mouth.
