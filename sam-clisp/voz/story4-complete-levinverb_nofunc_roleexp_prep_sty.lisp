         ;; In a certain kingdom in a certain land there lived a king who had three sons.
         ;; One day they said to him: "Father, our gracious sovereign, give us your blessing; we wish to go hunting."
         ;; The father gave them his blessing and they set out in different directions.
         ;; The youngest son rode and rode and lost his way; he came to a clearing, and there lay a dead horse, around which were gathered beasts of many kinds, birds, and reptiles.
         ;; A falcon rose, flew up to the prince, perched on his shoulder, and said: "Prince Ivan, divide that horse among us; it has lain here for thirty years, and we have been quarreling ever since, unable to find a way of sharing it."
         ;; The prince climbed down from his good steed and divided the carcass: he gave the bones to the beasts, the flesh to the birds, the skin to the reptiles, and the head to the ants.
         ;; "Thank you, Prince Ivan," said the falcon.
         ;; "For your kindness you shall be able to turn into a bright falcon or an ant whenever you wish."
         ;; Prince Ivan struck the damp earth, turned into a bright falcon, soared up into the air, and flew to the thrice tenth kingdom.
         ;; The prince flew straight into the royal palace, turned into a goodly youth, and asked the palace guards: "Will your king take me into his service?"
         ;; "Why should he not take such a goodly youth?" they answered.
         ;; Thus he entered the service of that king and lived in his palace for one week, then a second, then a third.
         ;; The king's daughter asked her father: "Father, my sovereign, give me leave to take a ride with Prince Ivan to the crystal mountain."
         ;; The king gave her leave.
         ;; They mounted good steeds and set out.
         ;; When they approached the crystal mountain, a golden goat jumped suddenly out from nowhere.
         ;; The prince chased it; he galloped and galloped, but could not catch the goat, and when he returned the princess had vanished.
