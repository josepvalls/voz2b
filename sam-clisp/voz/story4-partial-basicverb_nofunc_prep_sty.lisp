         ;; In a certain kingdom in a certain land there lived a king who had three sons.
         ;; One day they said to him: "Father, our gracious sovereign, give us your blessing; we wish to go hunting."
         ;; The father gave them his blessing and they set out in different directions.
         ;; The youngest son rode and rode and lost his way; he came to a clearing, and there lay a dead horse, around which were gathered beasts of many kinds, birds, and reptiles.
         ;; A falcon rose, flew up to the prince, perched on his shoulder, and said: "Prince Ivan, divide that horse among us; it has lain here for thirty years, and we have been quarreling ever since, unable to find a way of sharing it."
