         ;; Shall I amuse you with a little tale?
         ;; It's a wonderful tale.
         ;; There are marvelous marvels, wondrous wonders, and the laborer Shabarsha, Shabarsha who is a rogue among rogues: oh, well, in for a penny, in for a pound!
         ;; So Shabarsha set off to work as a laborer, and times were bad.
         ;; But one owner thought, a deep thought.
         ;; How could he chase away his misery, what could he live on, where could he get some money?
         ;; "Don't worry about it," said Shabarsha to him.
         ;; "There'll come a day and there will be both grain and money!"
         ;; And Shabarsha set off for the millpond.
         ;; "At any rate I can catch some fish.
         ;; I'll sell them and I'll have some money.
         ;; But I've no line and no hook.
         ;; Wait a minute and I'll make one."
         ;; He asked the miller for a handful of hemp, sat down on the shore, and started weaving his tackle.
         ;; He wove and wove, and then a boy in a black shirt and red hat jumped out of the water.
         ;; "Grandfather!
         ;; What are you doing here?" he asked.
         ;; "I'm weaving a line."
         ;; "Why?"
         ;; "I intend to cleanse this pond of all you devils by pulling you out of the water."
         ;; "Oh, no!
         ;; Wait a little.
         ;; I'll go and tell grandfather."
         ;; The imp dove deep down and Shabarsha went back to his work.
         ;; "Wait a minute," he thought, "I'll play a trick on you, you cursed ones.
         ;; You'll bring me some gold and silver."
         ;; And Shabarsha began digging a pit and when he had dug it, he placed his hat with a cutout hole over it.
         ;; "Shabarsha, oh Shabarsha!
         ;; Grandfather says that you and I should trade.
         ;; What will you take not to drag us out of the water?"
         ;; "Fill that hat full of gold and silver."
         ;; The imp dove back into the water.
         ;; He came back and said, "Grandfather says that you and I should first wrestle."
         ;; "What do you mean, milksop; why should I wrestle with the likes of you?
         ;; You couldn't even deal with my middle brother, Misha."
         ;; "And where is your Misha?"
         ;; "Look over there.
         ;; He's resting in that ravine under a bush."
         ;; "How can I call him out?"
         ;; "Go up to him and hit him in the side.
         ;; Then he'll get up of his own accord."
         ;; The imp went into the ravine, found the bear, and whacked him in the side with his club.
