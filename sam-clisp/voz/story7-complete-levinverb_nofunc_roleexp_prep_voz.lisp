         ;; This soldier got permission to go on leave.
         ;; He walked and walked, but nowhere did he see any water and he wanted to wet his hardtack and eat a little along the way and road.
         ;; His belly had long since been empty.
         ;; There was nothing to be done and so he dragged himself on a bit further.
         ;; Then he looked and saw a creek running.
         ;; He went up to this creek and got three biscuits out of his pack and put them in the water.
         ;; Besides  the hardtack the soldier had this fiddle.
         ;; In his free time he played various songs to chase away his boredom.
         ;; So the soldier sat down next to the stream and began playing.
         ;; Suddenly out of nowhere the Unclean One with the appearance of an old man came up to him with a book in his hands.
