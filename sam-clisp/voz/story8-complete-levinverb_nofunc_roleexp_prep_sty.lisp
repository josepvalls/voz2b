         ;; There was once a king who had three daughters, and such beauties they were as no tongue can tell of nor pen describe.
         ;; Their garden was big and beautiful and they liked to walk there at night.
         ;; A dragon from the Black Sea took to visiting this garden.
         ;; One night the king's daughters tarried in the garden, for they could not tear their eyes away from the flowers; suddenly the dragon appeared and carried them off on his fiery wings.
         ;; He sent his maidservants to look for them in the garden, but all in vain; the maidservants could not find the princesses.
         ;; The next morning the king proclaimed a state of emergency and a great multitude of people gathered.
