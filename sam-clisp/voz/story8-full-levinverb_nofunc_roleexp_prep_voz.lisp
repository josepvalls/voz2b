         ;; There was once a king who had three daughters, and such beauties they were as no tongue can tell of nor pen describe.
         ;; Their garden was big and beautiful and they liked to walk there at night.
         ;; A dragon from the Black Sea took to visiting this garden.
         ;; One night the king's daughters tarried in the garden, for they could not tear their eyes away from the flowers; suddenly the dragon appeared and carried them off on his fiery wings.
         ;; He sent his maidservants to look for them in the garden, but all in vain; the maidservants could not find the princesses.
         ;; The next morning the king proclaimed a state of emergency and a great multitude of people gathered.
         ;; Three men agreed to undertake this task - a soldier who was a drunkard, Frolka Stay-at-Home, and Erema; and they set out to look for the princesses.
         ;; As soon as they entered it they were overwhelmed by drowsiness.
         ;; Frolka Stay-at-Home drew a snuffbox out of his pocket, tapped on it, opened it, shoved a pinch of tobacco into his nose, and cried: "Eh, brothers, let us not sleep, let us not rest, let us keep going."
         ;; So they went on; they walked and walked and finally came to an enormous house, and in that house was a five-headed dragon.
         ;; For a long time they knocked at the gate, but no one answered.
         ;; Then Frolka Stay-at-Home pushed the soldier and Erema away and said: "Let me try, brothers!"
         ;; He snuffed up some tobacco and gave such a knock at the gate that he smashed it.
         ;; They entered the yard, sat in a circle, and were about to eat whatever they had.
         ;; Then a maiden of great beauty came out of the house and said: "Little doves, why have you come here?
         ;; A very wicked dragon lives here, who will devour you.
         ;; You are lucky that he happens to be away."
         ;; Frolka answered her: "It is we who shall devour him."
         ;; He had no sooner said these words than the dragon came flying and roared: "Who has ruined my kingdom?
         ;; Do I have enemies in the world?
         ;; I have only one enemy, but his bones won't even be brought here by a raven."
         ;; "A raven won't bring me," said Frolka, "but a good horse did."
         ;; The dragon upon hearing this said: "Have you come for peaceful purposes or to fight?"
         ;; "I have not come for peaceful purposes," said Frolka, "but to fight."
         ;; They moved apart, faced each other, and clashed, and in one stroke Frolka cut off all the five heads of the dragon.
         ;; Then he put them under a stone and buried the body in the ground.
         ;; The maiden was overjoyed and said to the three brave men: "My little doves, take me with you."
         ;; "But who are you?" they asked.
         ;; She said that she was the king's eldest daughter; Frolka told her what task he had undertaken, and they were both glad.
         ;; The princess invited them into the house, gave them meat and drink, and begged them to rescue her sisters.
         ;; Frolka said: "We were sent for them too!"
         ;; The princess told them where her sisters were.
         ;; "My next sister is even worse off than I was," she said.
         ;; "She is living with a seven-headed dragon."
         ;; "Never mind," said Frolka, "we shall get the better of him too; it may be somewhat harder to deal with a twelve-headed dragon."
         ;; They said farewell and went on.
         ;; Finally they came to the abode of the second sister.
         ;; The house where she was locked up was enormous and all around it there was a high iron fence.
         ;; They approached it and looked for the gate; finally they found it.
         ;; Frolka banged upon the gate with all his strength and it opened; they entered the yard and, as they had done before, sat down to eat.
         ;; Suddenly the seven-headed dragon came flying.
         ;; "I smell Russian breath here," he said.
         ;; "Bah, it is you, Frolka, who have come here!
         ;; What for?"
         ;; "I know what for," answered Frolka.
         ;; He began to fight with the dragon and in one stroke cut off all seven of his heads, put them under a stone, and buried the body in the ground.
         ;; Then they entered the house; they passed through one room, a second, and a third, and in the fourth they found the king's second daughter sitting on a sofa.
         ;; When they told her why and how they had come there, she brightened, offered them food and drink, and begged them to rescue her youngest sister from the twelve-headed dragon.
         ;; Frolka said: "Of course, that is what we were sent for.
         ;; But there is fear in my heart.
         ;; Well, perhaps God will help me!
         ;; Give us each another cup!"
         ;; They drank and left; they walked and walked till they came to a very steep ravine.
         ;; On the other side of the ravine there stood enormous pillars instead of a gate, and on the pillars were chained two ferocious lions that roared so loudly that only Frolka remained standing on his feet; his two companions fell to the ground from fear.
         ;; Frolka said to them: "I have seen worse terrors, and even then I was not frightened.
         ;; Come with me!"
         ;; And they went on.
         ;; Suddenly an old man, who looked to be about seventy, came out of the castle; he saw them, came to meet them, and said: "Whither are you going, my friends?"
         ;; "To this castle," answered Frolka.
         ;; "Ah, my friends," said the old man, "you are going to an evil place; the twelve-headed dragon lives in this castle.
         ;; He is not at home now, else he would have devoured you at once."
         ;; "But he is the very one we have come to see," said Frolka.
         ;; "If so," said the old man, "come with me, I will help you get to him."
         ;; The old man went up to the lions and began to stroke them, and Frolka with his companions got through to the courtyard.
         ;; They entered the castle; the old man brought them to the room where the princess lived.
         ;; Upon seeing them she quickly jumped off her bed and began to question them as to who they were and why they had come.
         ;; They told her.
         ;; The princess offered them food and drink and began to make ready to go.
         ;; As they were preparing to leave the house, they suddenly saw the dragon flying at a verst's distance from them.
         ;; The king's daughter rushed back into the house and Frolka and his companions went out to meet and fight the dragon.
         ;; At first the dragon attacked them with great force, but Frolka, a clever fellow, managed to defeat him, cut off all of his twelve heads, and cast them into the ravine.
         ;; Then they returned to the house and in their joy reveled even more than before.
         ;; Following this feast they set out on their way, stopping only for the other princesses.
         ;; Thus they all came back to their native land.
         ;; The king was overjoyed, opened his royal treasury to them, and said: "Now, my faithful servants, take as much money as you want for a reward."
         ;; Frolka was generous: he brought his big three-flapped cap, the soldier brought his knapsack, and Erema brought a basket.
         ;; Frolka began to fill his cap first: he poured and poured, the cap broke, and the silver fell into the mud.
         ;; Frolka began to pour again; he poured, and the money dropped from the cap!
         ;; "There is nothing to be done," said Frolka.
         ;; "Probably all of the royal treasury will fall to me."
         ;; "And what will be left for us?" asked his companions.
         ;; "The king has enough money for you too," said Frolka.
         ;; While there was still money, Erema began to fill his basket, and the soldier his knapsack; having done this, they went home.
         ;; But Frolka remained near the royal treasury with his cap and to this very day he is still sitting there, pouring out money for himself.
         ;; When his cap is filled, I shall go on with my story, but now I am too tired.
