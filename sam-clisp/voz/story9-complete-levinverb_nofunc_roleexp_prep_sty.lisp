         ;; There once lived an old couple who had one son called Ivashko; one can tell how fond they were of him!
         ;; Well, one day, Ivashko said to his father and mother: "I'll go out fishing if you'll let me."
         ;; "What are you thinking about!
         ;; you're still very small; suppose you get drowned, what good will there be in that?"
         ;; "No, no, I shan't get drowned.
         ;; I'll catch you some fish; do let me go!"
         ;; So his mother put a white shirt on him, tied a red girdle round him, and let him go.
         ;; Out in a boat he sat and said: Canoe, canoe, float a little farther,Canoe, canoe, float a little farther!
         ;; Then the canoe floated on farther and farther, and Ivashko began to fish.
         ;; When some little time had passed by, the old woman hobbled down to the river side and called to her son:Ivashechko, Ivashechko, my boy,Float up, float up unto the waterside;I bring thee food and drink.
         ;; And Ivashko said:Canoe, canoe, float to the waterside;That is my mother calling me.
         ;; The boat floated to the shore: the woman took the fish, gave her boy food and drink, changed his shirt for him and his girdle, and sent him back to his fishing.
         ;; Again he sat in his boat and said:Canoe, canoe, float a little farther,Canoe, canoe, float a little farther.
         ;; Then the canoe floated on farther and farther, and Ivashko began to fish.
         ;; After a little time had passed by, the old man also hobbled down to the bank and called to his son:Ivashechko, Ivashechko, my boy,Float up, float up, onto the waterside;I bring thee food and drink.
         ;; And Ivashko replied:Canoe, canoe, float to the waterside;That is my father calling me.
         ;; The canoe floated to the shore.
         ;; The old man took the fish, gave his boy food and drink, changed his shirt for him and his girdle, and sent him back to his fishing.
         ;; Now a certain witch had heard what Ivashko's parents had cried aloud to him, and she longed to get hold of the boy.
         ;; So she went down to the bank and cried with a hoarse voice: Ivashechko, Ivashechko, my boy,Float up, float up, onto the watersideI bring thee food and drink.
         ;; Ivashko perceived that the voice was not his mother's, but was that of a witch, and he sang:Canoe, canoe, float a little farther,Canoe, canoe, float a little farther;That is not my mother, but a witch who calls me.
         ;; The witch saw that she must call Ivashko with just such a voice as his mother had.
         ;; So she hastened to a smith and said to him: "Smith, smith make me just such a thin little voice as Ivashko's mother has: if you don't, I'll eat you."
         ;; So the smith forged her a little voice just like Ivashko's mother's.
         ;; Then the witch went down by night to the shore and sang:Ivashechko, Ivashechko, my boy,Float up, float up, unto the waterside;I bring thee food and drink.
         ;; Ivashko came, and she took the fish, and seized the boy and carried him home with her.
         ;; So Alenka heated the stove hot, ever so hot, and said to Ivashko, "Come here and sit on this shovel!"
