There was once an old princess; she had a son and a daughter, both well built, both handsome.
A wicked witch disliked them; she pondered and pondered as to how she could lead them into evil ways and destroy them.
In the end she conceived a plan.
The old woman believed her and was overjoyed; before her death she enjoined upon her son that he take to wife a woman whom the ring would be found to fit.
Time went by and the little son grew up.
He grew up and began to seek a bride; he would like one girl, then another, but upon trying the ring he always found it to be too big or too small; it did not fit either the one or the other.
He traveled and traveled through villages and cities, tried the ring on all the lovely maidens, but could not find one whom he could take as his betrothed; he returned home and was pensive and sad.
He told her his trouble.
She put it on her finger and the ring clasped it, and began to gleam; it fitted her as though made to her size.
But her brother did not heed her; he danced for joy and ordered that preparations be made for the wedding.
The sister burst into bitter tears, went out of her room, sat on the threshold, and wept and wept.
Some old women passed by; she invited them in and offered them food and drink.
They asked her what her grief was, why she was sad.
It was of no use to hide it; she told them everything.
The old women left.
The earth began to open, the sister began to fall in.
Only the sister's head was still above ground.
The dolls cuckooed, and she vanished into the earth.
The brother called her, he called her again in a louder voice, but she did not come.
He ran to her room, banged at the door, and the door broke.
He looked everywhere, but his sister was gone.
He seized an ax, cut off their heads, and threw them into the stove.
The sister walked and walked underground and saw a little hut on chicken legs, turning round and round.
The little hut stood still and the door opened.
Inside sat a lovely maiden embroidering a towel with silver and gold.
The guest was frightened by these words, but she had nowhere to go, so she sat with her hostess at the embroidery frame; they embroidered the towel and talked together.
After a long time or a short time, when the hostess knew that her mother was about to come - for she knew the time - she turned her guest into a needle, thrust the needle into a birch broom, and put the broom in a corner.
She had no sooner done all this than the witch appeared at the door.
She left; the maidens sat at the frame, embroidered the towel, talked and laughed together.
The witch came flying home; she sniffed about in the house.
The witch was hungry; she chided her daughter, and flew away again.
The guest had been sitting in the broom.
They hastened to finish embroidering the towel; while working thus hurriedly they planned how to escape from their trouble and run away from the wicked witch.
The maiden looked at the witch and her heart failed her.
They brought wood, oak and maple, and made a fire; the flame blazed forth from the stove.
The maiden changed her posture, sat the right way; the witch tried to shove her in, but she put one leg into the stove and the other under it.
"Sit quietly, this way - just see how I do it."
She plumped herself on the shovel and stretched out her legs, and the two maidens quickly shoved her into the stove, locked her in, covered her up with logs, plastered and tarred the opening, and then ran away, taking the embroidered towel and a brush and comb with them.
They threw down the brush and there appeared a marsh thickly overgrown with reeds.
They threw down the comb, and there appeared a dark, thick forest: not even a fly could fly through it.
The witch sharpened her teeth and set to work: each time she clamped her teeth she bit off a tree by its roots.
She hurled the trees to one side, cleared a path, and again came close - very close.
The maidens ran and ran till they could run no longer; they had lost all their strength.
They threw down the gold-embroidered towel, and there spread before them a sea, wide and deep, a sea of fire.
The witch soared high; she wanted to fly across the sea, but fell into the fire and was burned.
The maidens remained alone, little doves without a home; they did not know where to go.
They sat down to rest.
The master went to see them and invited them to his home.
He saw that his sister was there, but which of the two she was he could not guess - his servant had told the truth.
They did what they had planned; the servant struck his master in the side and blood gushed forth.
