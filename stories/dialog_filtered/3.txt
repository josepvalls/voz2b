In a certain kingdom in a certain land there lived one Bukhtan Bukhtanovich, who had a stove built on pillars in the middle of a field.
He lay on the stove in cockroach milk up to his elbows.
The fox took it home, stuck a kopek behind the hoop of the measure, and brought it back to the tsar.
The Fox took it home, stuck what remained of his coins behind the hoop, and brought it back to the tsar.
The fox ran home.
He dressed and, accompanied by the fox, went to the tsar.
They walked along the market place and had to cross on a board over a muddy ditch.
The fox gave Bukhtan a push and he fell into the mud.
The fox ran to him.
Saying this, the fox smeared him with mud all over.
The fox took the clothes and came to Bukhtan Bukhtanovich.
They came to the tsar, and at the tsar's palace the table was already set.
Bukhtan did not look at anything except himself: he had never seen such clothes in his life.
Bukhtan Bukhtanovich stared at a chair - it was a gilded one.
The tsar flung the chair out of the room.
They began to talk about the purpose of their visit, the match.
Three ships were loaded for Bukhtan Bukhtanovich and they traveled homeward.
Bukhtan Bukhtanovich and his wife were on one of the ships, and the fox ran along the shore.
Bukhtan Bukhtanovich sailed on, and the fox ran ahead of him on the shore.
He came to a hill and climbed it.
On the hill stood a huge stone house, and around it was an enormous kingdom.
The fox went into the house and at first saw no one; then he ran into a chamber, and there in the best bed lay Dragon, Son of the Dragon, stretching himself.
Raven, Son of the Raven, was perched on the chimney, and Cat, Son of the Cat, sat on a throne.
And the fox sealed him up in the barrel.
And the fox sealed him up in the mortar; then he wrapped Dragon, Son of the Dragon, in straw and took him out into the street.
The ships arrived.
The fox ordered all the beasts to be thrown into the water; the Cossacks threw them in at once.
Bukhtan Bukhtanovich moved all his possessions into that house; there he lived happily and prospered, ruled and governed, and there he ended his life.
