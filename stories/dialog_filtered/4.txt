In a certain kingdom in a certain land there lived a king who had three sons.
The father gave them his blessing and they set out in different directions.
The youngest son rode and rode and lost his way; he came to a clearing, and there lay a dead horse, around which were gathered beasts of many kinds, birds, and reptiles.
The prince climbed down from his good steed and divided the carcass: he gave the bones to the beasts, the flesh to the birds, the skin to the reptiles, and the head to the ants.
Prince Ivan struck the damp earth, turned into a bright falcon, soared up into the air, and flew to the thrice tenth kingdom.
More than half of that kingdom had been swallowed into a crystal mountain.
Thus he entered the service of that king and lived in his palace for one week, then a second, then a third.
The king gave her leave.
They mounted good steeds and set out.
When they approached the crystal mountain, a golden goat jumped suddenly out from nowhere.
The prince chased it; he galloped and galloped, but could not catch the goat, and when he returned the princess had vanished.
Prince Ivan drove his herd over mountains and valleys.
The dragon flew into a rage, and instead of three cows, seized six.
Prince Ivan straightway turned into a bright falcon, cut off all the three heads of the dragon, and drove the cattle home.
Next day the prince drove his herd over mountains and valleys, and the six-headed dragon came from the lake and demanded six cows.
The dragon flew into a rage and instead of six, seized twelve cows; but the prince turned into a bright falcon, fell upon the dragon, and cut off his six heads.
Late at night Prince Ivan turned into an ant and crawled into the crystal mountain through a little crack.
Lo and behold, the princess was in the crystal mountain.
Prince Ivan crawled out of the mountain, turned again into a herdsman, and drove his herd.
They began to fight, and after a long struggle or a short struggle, Prince Ivan defeated the twelve-headed dragon, slashed open his trunk, and found the coffer in his right side.
In the coffer he found a hare, in the hare a duck, in the duck an egg, in the egg a seed.
He took the seed, set it alight, and brought it to the crystal mountain, which soon melted away.
The wedding was held at once.
