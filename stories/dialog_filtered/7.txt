This soldier got permission to go on leave.
He got ready and set off along the way.
He walked and walked, but nowhere did he see any water and he wanted to wet his hardtack and eat a little along the way and road.
His belly had long since been empty.
There was nothing to be done and so he dragged himself on a bit further.
Then he looked and saw a creek running.
He went up to this creek and got three biscuits out of his pack and put them in the water.
Besides  the hardtack the soldier had this fiddle.
In his free time he played various songs to chase away his boredom.
So the soldier sat down next to the stream and began playing.
Suddenly out of nowhere the Unclean One with the appearance of an old man came up to him with a book in his hands.
The soldier opened up the book and started reading, just as if he had done so from his early years.
He was delighted and immediately handed over his fiddle.
The Unclean One took it and began working at it with the bow, but no way did things go right!
He couldn't make it play anything at all.
He took the hardtack out of the stream as he wanted to eat something.
The soldier ate and drank his fill and then he agreed to stay on and teach this unknown old man how to play the fiddle.
He stayed with him for three days and then he asked to go home.
The devil led him outside and there before the porch stood a troika of fine horses.
He got there in nothing flat.
The soldier got down from the cart, went in to his relatives, and they all exchanged greetings and asked about each other, for how long and when he had been given leave, It seemed to him that he had been with the Unclean One for no more than three days but in fact it had been three years.
His leave had long since finished and he was considered a runaway in his regiment.
The soldier became timid.
He didn't know what to do.
His stupidity simply wouldn't leave him.
He had no sooner spoken these words than the Unclean One was there.
So our merchant lived and worried about nothing.
Happiness just tumbled onto his household.
And in his trading he had just one task: to become even more prosperous.
The other merchants became envious, however.
The merchants went their separate ways to their own homes.
He thought and thought and then he decided to leave his shop and go out of the town that very night.
So he took all his money that was to hand and set out for the thrice-ten kingdom.
He walked and walked until he came to a barrier.
The sentry reported this to the courtiers and the courtiers reported this to the king himself.
The king called in the soldier.
The soldier waited until evening, bought himself a fiddle, and set off to the princess's.
In her rooms he lit the candles and began drinking and carousing, and playing on his fiddle.
At midnight the Unclean One came, heard the music, and rushed to the soldier.
But he brought him a full glass of the strong spirits.
The devil drank it all and his eyes popped right out on his forehead.
The devil chewed and chewed, but he just broke his teeth.
Then they started playing cards.
Meanwhile, time passed, the cocks crowed, and the Unclean One disappeared.
The next night passed the same way.
At deepest midnight the Unclean One appeared.
They started drinking and carousing.
The devil put both hands in the pincers and the soldier squeezed them.
Then he picked up the rods and let the devil have it!
But he kept on flogging him.
The devil hopped and hopped.
He twisted and twisted.
When he had said this, he disappeared.
So the soldier married the princess and lived with her in love and harmony, and then after several years the king died and he began ruling the entire tsardom.
Once the new king and his wife went into the garden to walk.
The king got ready and drove there with the queen.
