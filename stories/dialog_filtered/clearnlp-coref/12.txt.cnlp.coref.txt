In old times there was a village where a serpent frequently flew . He had devoured all but one of the villagers . At that time a gypsy came to the village . He came at night and no matter where he looked , he could n't find anyone ! He finally entered the last hut where the last man was sitting and crying . So , they spent the night . The next morning , a strong windstorm suddenly arose . The hut shook when the serpent landed . The serpent grabbed a millstone . The serpent grabbed the stone with the palm of his hand and squeezed it so tightly that it turned into fine sand - a cloud of dust arose from his fist . There was a chunk of cheese curd on the table , the gypsy grabbed it and really gave it a squeeze . Whey dripped out onto the ground . The serpent whistled so loudly that leaves fell from all the trees . The serpent believed it and covered his eyes with a scarf . There was nothing to be done - the gypsy went to the meadow . He saw a large herd of oxen grazing . He started to tie them together by their tails . The serpent waited and waited and could n't wait any longer . He ran out to the meadow to see what was going on . Then the serpent grabbed the biggest oxen by the tale , ripped off the hide , shouldered the meat and dragged it home . They returned to the hut , and set up two cauldrons for the beef , but there was no water . The gypsy grabbed the hide and dragged it to the well . Completely empty he could barely drag it , to say nothing of it when filled with water . He got to the well and started to dig a deep trench around it . The serpent again waited and waited and could n't wait any longer . He ran out to see for himself what was taking so long . The serpent dropped the hide into the well , filled it with water , dragged it out and carried it home . The gypsy went into the forest and pulled out bark fiber to twist into a rope . He braided an extremely long rope and set to wrapping up the oak trees . The serpent waited and waited and could n't wait any longer . He ran out to see for himself what was taking so long . The gypsy pretended like he was extremely angry . Pouting , he sat silently . The serpent cooked the beef , and called the gypsy to lunch . Right away , the serpent got his wagon , harnessed three of the best stallions , and they left together for the gypsy camp . They were just approaching , when the little gypsy children saw their father . Barely dressed , they ran to meet him . The serpent jumped out of the wagon and ran away . The gypsy sold the trio of horses with the wagon and began to live the good life .
