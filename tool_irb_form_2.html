  <p>In this page we will show you several short story snippets. 
  We will show you multiple variations of each story. The different variations share a common initial setup (<span class="initial">highlighted in blue</span>) but vary in that each has a different continuation (<span class="continuation">highlighted in purple</span>).
  We ask you to read each of them and rate each of the continuations in terms of how well they follows the initial setup and your overall satisfaction with the text.</p>
