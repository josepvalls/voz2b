  <h1>Evaluation of Automatic Story Generation Systems</h1>
  <p>In this page we will show you several short story snippets. 
  We will show you multiple variations of each story. The different variations share a common initial setup (<span class="initial">highlighted in blue</span>) but vary in that each has a different continuation (<span class="continuation">highlighted in purple</span>).
  We ask you to read each of them and rate each of the continuations in terms of how well they follows the initial setup and your overall satisfaction with the text.</p>
  <p id="tooltips_note">Note that throughout this page, you will find pieces of <em title="This is an example of the additional explanations you may find throughout this page.">text in italics</em>. Feel free to hover your mouse cursor on them to obtain additional explanations.</p>
